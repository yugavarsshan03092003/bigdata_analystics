INVITATION TO

THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO 2010

invitation to join the government of britain
A country is at its best when the bonds between people are strong and when the sense of
national purpose is clear. Today the challenges facing Britain are immense. Our economy is
overwhelmed by debt, our social fabric is frayed and our political system has betrayed the people.
But these problems can be overcome if we pull together and work together. If we remember that
we are all in this together.
Some politicians say: ‘give us your vote and we will sort out all your problems’. We say:
real change comes not from government alone. Real change comes when the people are
inspired and mobilised, when millions of us are fired up to play a part in the nation’s future.
Yes this is ambitious. Yes it is optimistic. But in the end all the Acts of Parliament, all
the new measures, all the new policy initiatives, are just politicians’ words without you and
your involvement.
How will we deal with the debt crisis unless we understand that we are all in this together?
How will we raise responsible children unless every adult plays their part? How will we
revitalise communities unless people stop asking ‘who will fix this?’ and start asking ‘what can
I do?’ Britain will change for the better when we all elect to take part, to take responsibility – if
we all come together. Collective strength will overpower our problems.
Only together can we can get rid of this government and, eventually, its debt. Only together
can we get the economy moving. Only together can we protect the NHS. Improve our schools.
Mend our broken society. Together we can even make politics and politicians work better. And
if we can do that, we can do anything. Yes, together we can do anything.
So my invitation today is this: join us, to form a new kind of government for Britain.



foreword
Britain needs change: few can doubt that. Our national finances are mired in massive debt.
Millions are living the misery of unemployment. Communities are shattered by crime and abuse.
People in the public services are trapped in a web of rules and regulations. People have lost faith
that politics can fix our problems, or that politicians can lead us into a better future. There is a
feeling of helplessness. Once again, there is a mood afoot that the decline of Britain is inevitable.
But there is no law that says we must accept decline. We have the energy, the ideas and the
ambition to get Britain back on track. And that includes everyone in Britain, wherever they live
and whatever their circumstances. If we join together, if we act decisively, and move forward with
optimism, we can start to fix the economic, social and political problems that threaten the nation.
We can bring about the change Britain needs.
What is that change? Some promise solutions from on high – but real change comes from
collective endeavour. So we offer a new approach: a change not just from one set of politicians to
another; from one set of policies to another. It is a change from one political philosophy to another.
From the idea that the role of the state is to direct society and micro-manage public services, to the
idea that the role of the state is to strengthen society and make public services serve the people who
use them. In a simple phrase, the change we offer is from big government to Big Society.
This manifesto is the most important stage so far on a journey that began four and a half years
ago, when the Conservative Party itself voted for change by electing David Cameron as its leader.
Since then, the Party has remoulded itself for the modern era, applying its deepest values and
beliefs to the urgent problems of the hour. Even as it has done so, the problems confronting Britain
have escalated, and escalated fast. So our ideas are ambitious and radical as well as modern. They
match the scale of Britain’s problems, and are in tune with a world that is changing before our eyes.
But our core values have not altered and our core beliefs remain consistent.
We believe in responsibility: government responsibility with public finances, personal
responsibility for our actions, and social responsibility towards each other. We believe in enterprise
and aspiration. We believe there is such a thing as society, it’s just not the same thing as the state.
Our fundamental tenet is that power should be devolved from politicians to people, from the central
to the local. Personal ambition should be set as high as is humanly possible, with no barriers put in
its way by the state. Perhaps most importantly, we believe that we are all in this together.
Everything you will find in this manifesto is built on these beliefs. They are the building blocks
of the change we want to see in every home, every street, every community, every business.



Our belief in responsibility with public finances is the starting point of our plan for economic
recovery and growth. We want your consent for a programme of public spending control that will
deal with Labour’s debt crisis and stop the Labour jobs tax that would kill our economic recovery.
The programme set out in this manifesto is fully costed and fully funded. Some of our proposals –
such as on school discipline – cost nothing, but require energy and leadership. Others – like
stopping Labour’s jobs tax – will require money, and we will make savings in other areas to pay
for them. The debt crisis is the terrible legacy that Gordon Brown is bequeathing to our country.
But fiscal responsibility needs a social conscience or it is not responsible at all: so we will not allow
the poorest people in Britain to pay an unfair price for the mistakes of some of the richest.
Nor will we allow irresponsibility in the private sector to continue unchecked. We will bring
law and order to our financial markets as a necessary step to restoring confidence. But the real
prize for Britain is to create a new economic model, one founded on investment and savings not
borrowing and debt. This economic vision reflects our belief in enterprise and aspiration. It is a
vision of a truly modern economy: one that is greener and more local. An economy where Britain
leads in science, technology and innovation. But it is founded on a determination that wealth
and opportunity must be more fairly distributed. We want to see an economy where not just our
standard of living, but everyone’s quality of life, rises steadily and sustainably.
But a nation is only really successful if it is built on a strong society. We will never deal with
our debts and build a new economy unless we solve the social problems that cost so much and hold
so many people back. Labour’s big government approach is making our social problems worse, not
better – inequality and poverty on the rise; social mobility stalled; family breakdown a fact
of life for too many children. So we need fundamental change: from big government that presumes
to know best, to the Big Society that trusts in the people for ideas and innovation.
We will move from state action to social action, encouraging social responsibility in all its
forms and across all the country – whether curbing incivility on our streets or supporting social
enterprises with the power to transform neighbourhoods. Mending Britain’s broken society will
be a central aim of the next Conservative government.
That is why in this manifesto we set ourselves an ambitious goal: to make Britain the most
family-friendly country in Europe. That is why we back the NHS. That is why we will reform
schools to raise standards and restore discipline. It is why we will get people off benefits and into
work; reform policing, sentencing and prisons. And why we are committed to a greener future.



But we will not succeed in building the Big Society, or in building a new economic model,
unless we stop government trying to direct everything from the centre. We will get nowhere with
yet more top-down state control. So, after thirteen years of Labour, we need radical political
reform. We need to change the whole way this country is run. As Conservatives, we trust people.
We believe that if people are given more responsibility, they will behave more responsibly. We
believe that if you decentralise power, you get better results and better value for money. So the
plans set out in this manifesto represent an unprecedented redistribution of power and control
from the central to the local, from politicians and the bureaucracy to individuals, families and
neighbourhoods.
We will give people much more say over the things that affect their daily lives. We will make
government, politics and public services much more open and transparent. And we will give the
people who work in our public services much greater responsibility. But in return, they will have
to answer to the people. All these measures will help restore trust in our broken political system.
We know that this is an ambitious vision. A profoundly optimistic vision. It is also an
authentically Conservative vision: sound money, backing enterprise, trusting people. The journey
we embarked on four and a half years ago was all about applying this Conservative approach
to the progressive challenges of our age: making opportunity more equal; fighting poverty and
inequality; improving the environment and general well-being. So our creed today is progressive
Conservatism; and this is an unashamedly progressive Conservative manifesto.
Now we ask you to join us for the next and most important stage of the journey: changing
Britain so we can offer a better life to all our citizens and play a proud and leading role in the world.
Each of the three programmes of reform outlined in this manifesto – our plans to build a new
economic model; to build the Big Society; to build a political system where people have more
power and control over their lives – is a massive undertaking in its own right. Yet we are proposing
to carry out these changes all at once, because that is the only way to put Britain on the right path
for a successful future.
Britain faces huge problems that demand radical change; and it cannot come soon enough.
We are impatient to get on with this work. We are determined to make a difference. We have the
policies to make that difference. And most importantly, we have faith in the people of Britain,
because we know that if we all pull together, stick together, then this country can change its future.



Glasgow
Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and home to 13,000
businesses, including some of Britain’s most successful firms. For
example, eight of the ten largest insurance companies in the UK have
an office in Glasgow, and the city is also home to leading technology,
energy and creative businesses. Glasgow is the hub of an important
entrepreneurial sector, which includes innovative start-ups in fields
such as mobile telephony and computer games. Glasgow’s commercial
strength also extends to manufacturing, and the city continues to be a
global leader in hi-tech ship building.



Change the economy
Get the economy moving
Gordon Brown’s debt, waste and taxes have wrecked the economy and threaten to kill the
recovery. A Conservative government will take action now to cut the deficit, stop Labour’s jobs
tax, help keep mortgage rates low and get the economy moving. We will create a new economic
model built on investment and savings, not borrowing and debt.
Where is the growth going to come from? Who will provide jobs for the millions out of work?
How will families be able to aspire to a better future? These are the questions being asked about
Britain, at home and abroad.
One thing is clear. We can’t go on with the old model of an economy built on debt. Irresponsible
public spending, an overblown banking sector, and unsustainable consumer borrowing on the back
of a housing bubble were the features of an age of irresponsibility that left Britain badly exposed to
the economic crisis. Now, with the national debt already doubled and in danger of doubling again, it
is this debt – together with the jobs tax that Labour will introduce to help pay for it – that threatens
to kill the recovery.
Britain needs a new economic model. Saving and business investment must replace reckless
borrowing as the foundation of growth. We need to boost enterprise and develop a low carbon,
hi-tech economy. Our exports must grow. We need to get Britain working by creating jobs in the
private sector, and we must get better value for money from the public sector.
With the next Conservative government, our tax system, education and national infrastructure
will help British firms out-compete their global rivals, not hold them back. We will build a more
balanced economy that does not depend so heavily on the success of financial services, and where
all parts of the country share in the gains. The bedrock of this new economic model will be the
stability and low interest rates that come from a credible plan to reduce our record budget deficit,
protect Britain’s credit rating and give taxpayers value for their money.
Building this new economic model requires a national effort. We can reverse Britain’s economic
decline – but only if we accept that we are all in this together. No government, even a strong and
united one, can create a better country alone. It needs individuals, families and businesses pulling
alongside. We want to unite everyone in our country behind this bold vision of a new British
economic model.



Benchmarks for Britain
For the first time, the British people will have eight clear and transparent benchmarks against
which they can judge the economic success or failure of the next government. We will be
accountable and open. These are the eight Benchmarks for Britain. Achieving them over the next
Parliament will mean we have put Britain back on its feet and are building a new British economic
model, very different from the debt-driven economy of recent years.
change the economy | benchmarks for britain
1. Ensure macroeconomic stability: We will safeguard Britain’s credit rating with a credible plan
to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will seek to
help keep interest rates lower for longer. The independent Bank of England will continue to
target 2 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, and will use its new role in prudential
supervision to preserve financial stability.
2. Create a more balanced economy: We will create the conditions for higher exports, business
investment and saving as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
3. Get Britain working again: We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of
children in workless households as part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality.
4. Encourage enterprise: We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness
and business regulation.
5. Ensure the whole country shares in rising prosperity: We will increase the private sector’s share
of the economy in all regions of the country, especially outside London and the South East.
6. Reform public services to deliver better value for money: We will raise productivity growth
in the public sector in order to deliver better schools and a better NHS.
7. Create a safer banking system that serves the needs of the economy: We will reform the
regulation and structure of the banking system to ensure lower levels of leverage, less
dependence on unstable wholesale funding, and greater availability of credit for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
8. Build a greener economy: We will reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions and increase our
share of global markets for low carbon technologies.



change the economy | ENSURE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
After a decade of mismanagement, the UK
entered the recession in poor shape, with the
second biggest budget deficit in the developed
world. We have been honest about the scale of
the problem, and the actions we will need to
take to deal with it. This will not be easy, but
we can overcome our problems if we all pull
together.
The absence of a credible plan to deal with our
record budget deficit, the largest of any major
economy, is creating uncertainty over Britain’s
credit rating and interest rates. This instability
undermines confidence and jeopardises
investment. It could tip Britain back into
recession. This is Gordon Brown’s legacy –
and why the greatest risk to our economic
recovery is five more years of Gordon Brown.
Urgent action to reduce debt
Urgent action is needed if we are to avoid the
higher borrowing costs that would inevitably
follow from a credit rating downgrade. So
we will cut wasteful government spending
to bring the deficit down and restore stability.
Ensure macroeconomic stability
We will safeguard Britain’s credit rating with a credible plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural
deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will help keep interest rates lower for longer. The
independent Bank of England will continue to target 2 per cent CPI inflation, and will use its new
role in prudential supervision to preserve financial stability.
We will increase spending on health in real
terms every year and honour our commitments
on international aid, but our plan to get a grip
on the deficit will include cuts to wasteful
spending in many other departmental budgets.
That will enable the independent Bank of
England to keep interest rates as low as possible
for as long as possible.
To ensure that no Labour government can
ever attempt to bankrupt our public finances
again, we will set up an independent Office
for Budget Responsibility to restore trust in
the government’s ability to manage the public
finances.
We will provide an emergency Budget within
50 days of taking office to set out a credible
plan for eliminating the bulk of the structural
current budget deficit over a Parliament. The
case for starting early to re-establish our
economic credibility is overwhelming, and is
backed by economists and business leaders.



We will start by cutting a net £6 billion of
wasteful departmental spending in the financial
year 2010/11. In addition, we will make the
following savings:
freeze public sector • pay for one year in
2011, excluding the one million lowest paid
workers;
• hold a review to bring forward the date at
which the state pension age starts to rise to
66, although it will not be sooner than 2016
for men and 2020 for women;
• stop paying tax credits to better-off families
with incomes over £50,000;
• cut government contributions to Child Trust
Funds for all but the poorest third of families
and families with disabled children;
• cap public sector pensions above £50,000;
• cut Ministers’ pay by 5 per cent, followed by
a five year freeze; and,
• reduce the number of MPs by 10 per cent.
Over the course of a Parliament, we will cut
Whitehall policy, funding and regulation
costs by a third, saving £2 billion a year, and
save a further £1 billion a year from quango
bureaucracy.
Cut government waste to stop
Labour’s jobs tax
Labour are planning to increase National
Insurance in 2011. Anyone earning over
£20,000 will pay more tax, and employers
will pay more tax on all jobs paid over £5,700.
This jobs tax, which will hit small businesses
especially hard, will kill off the recovery.
Experts predict it will cost 57,000 jobs in small
and medium-sized businesses alone.
At the same time, Labour will not take action to
cut waste in government. They have identified
£11 billion pounds of waste, but they do not
plan to start dealing with it until April 2011.
So Labour will continue wasting money while
putting up taxes on working people.
We will act immediately to cut government
waste so we can stop the most damaging part of
the National Insurance rise for employers and
for anyone earning under £35,000.
We will make the following changes in April
2011, relative to Labour’s plans:
• raise the primary threshold for National
Insurance by £24 a week and raise the Upper
Earnings Limit by £29 a week; and,
• raise the secondary threshold at which
employers start paying National Insurance
by £21 a week.



Seven out of ten working people – those
earning between £7,100 and £45,400 – and
almost every employer will save up to £150
a year per person compared to under Labour.
Lower earners will get the greatest benefit as
a percentage of their earnings. Nobody will be
worse off as a result of these changes.
Our plans are backed by many of Britain’s top
business leaders, who between them employ
more than half a million people, as well as by
Britain’s leading business organisations.
To pay for this we will take immediate action
to cut a net £6 billion of wasteful departmental
spending in the financial year 2010/11, with
further savings in future years. This is in
addition to the savings made by cutting tax
credits and Child Trust Funds for betteroff
families.
These actions will allow us to reduce the
deficit more quickly than Labour year-on-year
while avoiding the most damaging part of
their jobs tax. It will also lower the proportion
of the reduction of the structural deficit that
is accounted for by tax increases, from about
one third towards one fifth. This is in line
with international best practice, as well as the
Treasury’s own internal analysis.
Former government advisers Sir Peter Gershon
and Dr Martin Read have advised us that
savings of £12 billion across all departmental
spending are possible in-year without affecting
the quality of frontline services. These are
over and above any savings already planned by
Labour. We will achieve this through:
a freeze on major • new Information and
Communications Technologies (ICT)
spending;
• immediate negotiations to achieve cost
reductions from major suppliers;
• tighter control of public sector recruitment;
• reductions in discretionary spending,
including travel, expenses, advertising,
consultancy and office supplies; and,
• reductions in public sector property costs.
We will match Labour’s spending plans for
2010/11 in health and overseas aid. Given our
commitment to carry out a Strategic Defence
and Security Review, it would also not be
appropriate to make in-year reductions to the
existing defence budget in 2010/11. Savings
in these protected areas will be channelled
back into frontline services. The net £6 billion
of savings will be made from the remaining
departmental budgets.



For the last decade, growth has been too
dependent on government spending and debtfuelled
consumption. More than half of the new
jobs created were driven by public spending.
Household savings collapsed, and the UK has
the lowest investment as a share of GDP of
any G7 country. Our share of world exports
has fallen by almost a third. A sustainable
recovery must be driven by growth in exports
and business investment, and through a better
environment for wealth creation.
Make Britain the leading hi-tech
exporter in Europe
We will implement key recommendations from
Sir James Dyson’s Review into how to achieve
our goal of making Britain Europe’s leading
hi-tech exporter, including:
encouraging t • he establishment of
joint university-business research and
development institutes;
• initiating a multi-year Science and Research
Budget to provide a stable investment climate
for Research Councils;
Create a more balanced economy
We will create the conditions for higher exports, business investment and saving as a share of GDP.
• creating a better focus on Science,
Technology, Engineering and Maths
(STEM) subjects in schools; and,
• establishing a new prize for engineering.
Research and development tax credits will be
improved and refocused on hi-tech companies,
small businesses and new start-ups. At the
same time, we will give strong backing to the
growth industries that generate high-quality
jobs around the country.
We will improve the performance of UK
Trade and Investment with a renewed focus
on high priority sectors and markets where
the return on taxpayers’ money is highest. We
will regularly compare government support for
exporters and inward investment against the
services provided by our competitors. We will
work for the successful conclusion of the Doha
trade round and support bilateral free trade
negotiations between the European Union (EU)
and other countries.



Encourage saving and
investment
Only by saving more can we finance
investment for the future without being
dependent on unsustainable inflows of capital
from abroad. We will help stop the spread of
means-testing by restoring the link between
the basic state pension and average earnings,
making it worthwhile for people to save. Other
measures we will take to encourage saving
include:
reinvigorating occupational • pensions and
working with employers and industry to
support auto-enrolment into pensions;
• working with the trade unions, businesses
and others to address the growing disparity
between public sector pensions and private
sector pensions, while protecting accrued
rights; and,
• when resources allow, starting to reverse the
effects of the abolition of the dividend tax
credit for pension funds.
We will reward those who have saved for
their retirement by ending the effective
obligation to buy an annuity at age 75. And
we will raise the inheritance tax threshold
to £1 million to help millions of people who
aspire to pass something on to their children,
paid for by a simple flat-rate levy on all
non-domiciled individuals.
We must not let the mis-selling of financial
products put people off saving. We will
implement the Ombudsman’s recommendation
to make fair and transparent payments to
Equitable Life policy holders, through an
independent payment scheme, for their relative
loss as a consequence of regulatory failure.
Help households manage their
debts
Going into the recession, Britain’s consumer
debt was the highest in the G7. A Conservative
government will promote responsible consumer
finance by creating a powerful Consumer
Protection Agency (CPA) to take over the
Financial Services Authority’s consumer
protection role. In addition, we will:
• give the CPA new powers to define and ban
excessive borrowing rates on store cards;
• launch Britain’s first free national financial
advice service, funded in full through a
new social responsibility levy on the
financial services sector;
• introduce a seven-day cooling off period
for store cards;
• require credit card companies to provide
clear information; and,
• ensure that no-one is forced to sell their
home to pay unsecured debts of less
than £25,000.



Debbie Scott
“I’ve always believed that we’ll only solve our big social and economic problems if we
all get involved and try and make a difference. It’s never enough just to sit back and
think ‘well the government can take care of it’ – I think we’ve all got a responsibility
to do what we can. That’s why every day, my colleagues and I use all the innovation
and flexibility we can muster to help those furthest from the labour market to
overcome their personal barriers to work. For me, it is all about believing in the power
of people. Tomorrow’s People welcomes the concept of the single Work Programme –
it pulls everything together and allows organisations like ours to support people more
effectively on their individual journey from welfare into work.”
Debbie Scott is the Chief Executive of Tomorrow’s People, a national employment charity founded in 1984



Under Labour, youth unemployment has
reached over 900,000, with one in five
young people unable to find a job. We are at
risk of creating a lost generation of young
people without the skills to participate in the
workforce, without hope for the future. At the
same time, economic inactivity is rising, and
more than five million people are out of work
and on benefits.
This tidal wave of worklessness is making it
hard for many families to make ends meet. In
recent years, the number of people living in
severe poverty has risen. One in six children in
the UK now lives in a workless household – the
highest proportion of any country in Europe –
and child poverty has gone up in recent years.
Getting people back into work is an essential
part of realising the goal of eliminating child
poverty by 2020, and ensuring that everyone
benefits from economic growth.
Reduce welfare dependency
We will scrap Labour’s failing employment
schemes and create a single Work Programme
for everyone who is unemployed, including the
2.6 million people claiming Incapacity
Get Britain working again
We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of children in workless households as
part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality.
Benefit who do not get enough help from
existing programmes. We will reassess all
current claimants of Incapacity Benefit.
Those found fit for work will be transferred
onto Jobseeker’s Allowance. Recipients of
Incapacity Benefit who are genuinely disabled
will continue to receive the financial support to
which they are entitled. Our Work Programme
will:
offer people targeted, • personalised help
sooner – straight away for those with serious
barriers to work and at six months for those
aged under 25;
• be delivered through private and voluntary
sector providers, which will be rewarded on
a payment by results basis for getting people
into sustainable work;
• draw on a range of Service Academies
to offer pre-employment training for
unemployed people – our first Service
Academy, for hospitality and leisure, will
provide up to 50,000 training places and
work placements; and,



involve the development • of local Work
Clubs – places where people looking
for work can gather together to exchange
skills, find opportunities, make useful
contacts and provide mutual support.
Our plans will give unemployed people a hand
up, not a hand out. Unemployed people must
be prepared to take up job offers. So, with the
Conservatives, long-term benefit claimants
who fail to find work will be required to ‘work
for the dole’ on community work programmes.
Anyone on Jobseeker’s Allowance who refuses
to join the Work Programme will lose the right
to claim out-of-work benefits until they do,
while people who refuse to accept reasonable
job offers could forfeit their benefits for up to
three years. This will create a welfare system
that is fair but firm.
Boost small business
In the end, it is not the state that creates
sustainable employment – it is business people.
And small businesses are especially important
to the UK’s economic recovery and to tackling
unemployment. Government can help boost
enterprise by lowering tax rates, reducing
regulation and improving workers’ skills.
As well as stopping Labour’s jobs tax, for the
first two years of a Conservative government
any new business will pay no Employers
National Insurance on the first ten employees it
hires during its first year.
To support small businesses further, we will:
• make small business rate relief automatic;
and,
• aim to deliver 25 per cent of government
research and procurement contracts through
SME s by cutting the administrative costs of
bidding.
We will support would-be entrepreneurs
through a new programme – Work for Yourself
– which will give unemployed people direct
access to business mentors and substantial
loans. We need to make work pay, so we will
keep the minimum wage and work to reduce
the very high marginal tax rates faced by many
people on low incomes who want to return to
work or increase their earnings. We will look
at how to abolish the default retirement age, as
many older people want to carry on working.
And we will force equal pay audits on any
company found to be discriminating on the
basis of gender.
Improve skills and strengthen
higher education
Developing economies are able to provide
highly-skilled work at a fraction of the cost
of British labour. The only way we can
compete is by dramatically improving the
skills of Britain’s workforce, yet thousands
of young people leave school every year
without the skills they need to get a good



job. A Conservative government will not
accept another generation being consigned
to an uncertain future of worklessness and
dependency.
We will promote fair access to universities,
the professions, and good jobs for young people
from all backgrounds. We will use funding
that currently supports Labour’s ineffective
employment and training schemes, such as
Train2Gain, to provide our own help for people
looking to improve their skills. This will allow
us to:
create 400,000 work pairing, • apprenticeship,
college and training places over two years;
• give SME s a £2,000 bonus for every
apprentice they hire;
• establish a Community Learning Fund to
help people restart their careers; and,
• create a new all-age careers service so that
everyone can access the advice they need.
To meet the skills challenge we face, the
training sector needs to be given the freedom
to innovate. We will set colleges free from
direct state control and abolish many of the
further education quangos Labour have put in
place. Public funding will follow the choices of
students and be delivered by a single agency,
the Further Education Funding Council.
Universities contribute enormously to the
economy. But not all of this contribution comes
directly – it can come from fundamental
research with no immediate application – and
universities also have a crucial cultural role.
We will ensure that Britain’s universities enjoy
the freedom to pursue academic excellence
and focus on raising the quality of the student
experience. To enable this to happen, we will:
• delay the implementation of the Research
Excellence Framework so that it can be
reviewed – because of doubts about whether
there is a robust and acceptable way of
measuring the impact of all research;
• consider carefully the results of Lord
Browne’s review into the future of higher
education funding, so that we can unlock
the potential of universities to transform our
economy, to enrich students’ lives through
teaching of the highest quality, and to
advance scholarship; and,
• provide 10,000 extra university places this
year, paid for by giving graduates incentives
to pay back their student loans early on an
entirely voluntary basis.



Silicon Valley
Despite having a population twenty times smaller than the UK, Silicon Valley is a global
beacon for innovation and enterprise, attracting more venture capital investment than
the whole of the UK. Having led the internet revolution, Silicon Valley is now becoming
a world leader in green technology development. These successes are thanks to the
highly skilled workforce and world-class universities, the ease of starting a business, and
the availability of credit and investment. In addition, companies in Silicon Valley have
been able to attract employees in a highly competitive labour market by introducing
measures to improve the general well-being of their staff, including flexible working and
childcare facilities.



Thirteen years ago, Britain’s tax system was
one of the most competitive in the developed
world. Over the last decade, other countries
have cut their tax rates while our tax system has
become one of the most complex in the world.
Our competitiveness rating has fallen, while the
burden of regulation and the impact of taxation
have risen. We can only make a sustainable
economic recovery if we send a clear signal that
Britain is open for business again. That means
stopping Labour’s jobs tax, lowering corporate
tax rates, reducing the regulatory burden,
and supporting innovation and sustainable
development – changes that will benefit
businesses of all sizes and boost employment.
Cut and simplify business taxes
The Conservative Party believes in lower and
simpler taxation. That is why we will ensure
that by far the largest part of the burden of
dealing with the deficit falls on lower spending
rather than higher taxes. Cutting the deficit is
the most urgent task we need to undertake if
we are to get the economy moving, but it is not
enough. So, initially, we will cut the headline
rate of corporation tax to 25p and the small
companies’ rate to 20p, funded by reducing
complex reliefs and allowances.
Encourage enterprise
We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness and business regulation.
Over time, we hope to reduce these rates
further. Our ambition is to create the most
competitive tax system in the G20 within
five years.
We will restore the tax system’s reputation for
simplicity, stability and predictability. In our
first Budget, we will set out a five year road
map for the direction of corporate tax reform,
providing greater certainty and stability to
businesses. We will create an independent
Office of Tax Simplification to suggest reforms
to the tax system.
We will take a series of measures to encourage
Foreign Direct Investment into the UK,
including:
making the UK a more attractive • location for
multinationals by simplifying the complex
Controlled Foreign Companies rules;
• consulting on moving towards a territorial
corporate tax system that only taxes profits
generated in the UK; and,
• creating an attractive tax environment for
intellectual property.



Reduce regulation
Increasing amounts of red tape and complex
regulation have eroded Britain’s reputation
as a good place to invest, create jobs or start
a business. A Conservative government will
introduce regulatory budgets: forcing any
government body wanting to introduce a new
regulation to reduce regulation elsewhere by a
greater amount. And we will give the public the
opportunity to force the worst regulations to be
repealed.
To encourage new businesses to start up, we
will reduce the number of forms needed to
register a new business – moving towards a
‘one-click’ registration model – to make Britain
the fastest place in the world to start a business,
and end the restrictions on social tenants
starting a business from their homes.
We are proud of the last Conservative
government’s industrial relations reforms,
which helped bring about our economic revival
in the 1980s, and we will always be prepared to
build on them if necessary.
Support innovation and
sustainable development
Government procurement is a £200 billion a
year market that can be used much better to
stimulate enterprise and innovation. We will
take steps to open up government procurement
to small and innovative businesses by:
publishing online all • government tender
documents for contracts worth over £10,000
via the Supply2Gov website;
• creating a level playing field for open source
ICT in government procurement; and,
• opening up contracts to SME s by breaking
up large ICT projects into smaller
components.
Britain’s complex and unwieldy planning
system has long been cited as a significant
barrier to growth and wealth creation. We will
create a presumption in favour of sustainable
development in the planning system. We will
abolish the unelected Infrastructure Planning
Commission (IPC) and replace it with an
efficient and democratically-accountable
system that provides a fast-track process for
major infrastructure projects. We will:
• use private or hybrid Bills to promote major
projects, such as our plans for a national high
speed rail network;
• ensure that all other major infrastructure
projects are considered at planning inquiries
which have binding timetables and which
focus on planning issues – with final
permission given by a Minister; and,
• provide transitional arrangements for projects
already before the IPC to ensure that these
projects are not disrupted or delayed.



Attract the brightest and best to
our country
Immigration has enriched our nation over the
years and we want to attract the brightest and
the best people who can make a real difference
to our economic growth. But immigration
today is too high and needs to be reduced. We
do not need to attract people to do jobs that
could be carried out by British citizens, given
the right training and support. So we will take
steps to take net migration back to the levels
of the 1990s – tens of thousands a year, not
hundreds of thousands.
To help achieve this goal, we will introduce a
number of measures, such as:
setting an annual l • imit on the number of non-
EU economic migrants admitted into the UK
to live and work;
• limiting access only to those who will bring
the most value to the British economy; and,
• applying transitional controls as a matter of
course in the future for all new EU Member
States.
In addition, we will promote integration into
British society, as we believe that everyone
coming to this country must be ready to
embrace our core values and become a part
of their local community. So there will be an
English language test for anyone coming here
to get married.
We want to encourage students to come to our
universities and colleges, but our student visa
system has become the biggest weakness in our
border controls. A Conservative government
will strengthen the system of granting student
visas so that it is less open to abuse. We want
to make it easier for reputable universities and
colleges to accept applications, while putting
extra scrutiny on new institutions looking to
accept foreign students or existing institutions
not registered with Companies House. In
addition, we will:
• insist foreign students at new or unregistered
institutions pay a bond in order to study in
this country, to be repaid after the student
has left the country at the end of their studies;
• ensure foreign students can prove that
they have the financial means to support
themselves in the UK; and,
• require that students must usually leave the
country and reapply if they want to switch
to another course or apply for a work permit.



Too many areas of the UK lack a vibrant
private sector and are too dependent on public
spending. These regional imbalances have got
worse over the last decade, despite billions of
pounds spent by the Regional Development
Agencies (RDAs). Our aim is to increase the
private sector’s share of the economy in every
part of the country by boosting enterprise and
creating a better business environment. We
will work closely with local government, and
with the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly
and Northern Ireland Assembly, to achieve
this goal.
Create a modern transport
network
A rebalanced economy requires an extensive
and reliable infrastructure. But transport has
been a low priority for Labour, and the hassle
of getting around is bad for business, bad for
families and bad for everyone’s quality of life.
A Conservative government will begin work
immediately to create a high speed rail line
connecting London and Heathrow with
Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. This is
the first step towards achieving our vision of
creating a national high speed rail network to
Ensure the whole country shares in rising prosperity

outside London and the South East.

join up major cities across England, Scotland
and Wales. Stage two will deliver two new lines
bringing the North East, Scotland and Wales
into the high speed rail network.
Because travel abroad is so important for
our economy and for family holidays, we
need to improve our airports and reduce the
environmental impact of flying. Our goal is
to make Heathrow airport better, not bigger.
We will stop the third runway and instead
link Heathrow directly to our high speed rail
network, providing an alternative to thousands
of flights. In addition, we will:
block plans for second • runways at Stansted
and Gatwick; and,
• reform Air Passenger Duty to encourage a
switch to fuller and cleaner planes.
To improve life for commuters and encourage
people to switch to lower carbon public
transport, we will reform our railways to
provide a better focus on tackling problems
that matter most to passengers, such as
overcrowding. We will grant longer, more
flexible rail franchises to incentivise private
sector investment in improvements like longer
trains and better stations.



ENSURE THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHARES IN
RISING PROSPERITY
We support Crossrail and the electrification of
the Great Western line to South Wales. We will
turn the rail regulator into a powerful passenger
champion and reform Network Rail to make it
more accountable to its customers. And we will
introduce a moratorium on building on disused
rail lines still in public ownership, so they are
available to be re-opened.
Britain has the chance to lead the world in
making our transport system greener. So we
will introduce incentives for electricity network
operators to establish a new national car
recharging network, making it much easier
for drivers to move to electric and plug-in
hybrid vehicles. We will support sustainable
travel initiatives that work best for local
communities by:
giving the concerns • of cyclists much
greater priority;
• encouraging partnerships between
bus operators and local authorities; and,
• helping people cut down on work-related
travel.
We will stop central government funding
for new fixed speed cameras, and switch to
more effective ways to make our roads safer,
including authorising ‘drugalyser’ technology
for use in testing for drug-driving. We
will make companies that dig up our roads
accountable for the congestion they cause and
crack down on rogue clampers. Councils will
get more powers to get traffic flowing more
smoothly.
We will consult on the introduction of a ‘Fair
Fuel Stabiliser’. This would cut fuel duty
when oil prices rise, and vice versa. It would
ensure families, businesses and the whole
British economy are less exposed to volatile
oil markets, and that there is a more stable
environment for low carbon investment.
Spread prosperity
We want Britain to become a European hub
for hi-tech, digital and creative industries –
but this can only happen if we have the right
infrastructure in place. Establishing a superfast
broadband network throughout the UK
could generate 600,000 additional jobs and add
£18 billion to Britain’s GDP.
We will scrap Labour’s phone tax and instead
require BT and other infrastructure providers
to allow the use of their assets to deliver superfast
broadband across the country. If necessary,
we will consider using the part of the licence
fee that is supporting the digital switchover to
fund broadband in areas that the market alone
will not reach.
We will give councils and businesses the power
to form their own business-led local enterprise
partnerships instead of RDAs. Where local
councils and businesses want to maintain
regionally-based enterprise partnerships, they



will be able to. Local government should be at
the heart of our economic recovery, so we will:
allow councils to • keep above-average
increases in business rate revenue so that
communities which go for growth can reap
the benefits;
• give councils new powers to introduce
further discounts on business rates; and,
• introduce an immediate freeze of, and
inquiry into, the Government’s punitive
programme of back-dating business rates
on ports.



Public sector productivity has fallen under
Labour, acting as a drag on growth and
reducing the quality of our public services.
If productivity in the public sector had grown
at the same rate as in private sector services,
we could now have the same quality of public
services for £60 billion less each year. So, by
improving public sector productivity while
getting a grip on the debt, we will still be
able to deliver better public services. That
is why good government costs less with the
Conservatives.
Decentralisation, accountability
and transparency
We value the work of those employed in
our public services, and a Conservative
government will work with them to deliver
higher productivity and better value for
money for taxpayers. We will raise public
sector productivity by increasing diversity of
provision, extending payment by results and
giving more power to consumers.
Giving public sector workers ownership of the
services they deliver is a powerful way to drive
efficiency, so we will support co-operatives and
mutualisation as a way of transferring public
assets and revenue streams to public sector
Reform public services to deliver better value for money
We will raise productivity growth in the public sector in order to deliver better schools

change the economy REFORM PUBLIC SERVICES TO DELIVER
BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY
workers. We will encourage them to come
together to form employee-led co-operatives
and bid to take over the services they run. This
will empower millions of public sector workers
to become their own boss and help them to
deliver better services – the most significant
shift in power from the state to working people
since the sale of council houses in the 1980s.
Transparency is crucial to creating a value for
money culture. We will publish all items of
spending over £25,000 online, and the salaries
of senior civil servants in central government
will also be published. We will create strong
financial discipline at all levels of government
and place an obligation to manage taxpayers’
money wisely at the heart of civil service
employment contracts. In addition, we will:
introduce and publish a standard • set of cost
measures that capture the key drivers of
departmental spending;
• help departmental Finance Directors to
manage resources more efficiently;
• implement clear financial performance
targets for senior civil servants; and,
• create a focus on delivering strong financial
management across government.



In the run up to the financial crisis, British
banks became amongst the most indebted and
most leveraged in the world – with disastrous
consequences for us all. This credit boom
turned into a bust, with a significant fall in
credit available to firms. Lack of access to
credit remains a major problem, especially for
SME s. We need to change the way we regulate
our banks to stop a crisis on this scale ever
happening again.
Reform financial services
The financial services sector is one of our most
globally successful industries, and we want
the City to be the leading location for global
finance. But the financial sector must not put the
stability of the whole economy at risk.
We will put in place a levy on banks. We are
prepared to act unilaterally if necessary, but
there is emerging international agreement
on this approach and the US and German
governments have both announced similar
plans.
We need fundamental reform of our
failed regulatory system, avoiding badlydesigned
regulations that will damage our
competitiveness and ensuring that the financial

businesses need.
We will abolish Gordon Brown’s failed tripartite
system of regulation and put the Bank of England
in charge of prudential supervision. We will
restore the Bank’s historic role in monitoring
the overall growth of credit and debt in the
economy. In addition, we will:
pursue international a • greement to prevent
retail banks from engaging in activities, such
as large-scale proprietary trading, that put
the stability of the system at risk;
• empower the Bank of England to crack
down on risky bonus arrangements;
• increase competition in the banking industry,
starting with a study of competition in the
sector to inform our strategy for selling the
government’s stakes in the banks; and,
• as the government comes to sell off its holdings
in the banks, offer a ‘people’s bank bonus’, so
that everybody in the country has the chance
to buy a stake in the state-owned banks.
We will create more diverse sources of affordable
credit for small businesses, building on our
proposals for a National Loan Guarantee Scheme.



Japan
Japan is a world leader in the development of green technology. It invests
in R&D at almost double the UK’s rate, and Japanese companies hold
roughly 30 per cent of green technology patents filed in the US. As a
result, Japan is far ahead of the UK in the trillion pound market for green
technology. This leadership is not just good for the economy; it’s also good
for the environment. For example, thanks to the widespread use of green
technologies, Japan has the lowest carbon intensity of any major economy.



Labour have said the right things on climate
change, but these have proved little more than
warm words. Despite three White Papers,
a multitude of strategies and endless new
announcements, the UK now gets more of its
energy from fossil fuels than it did in 1997. Our
performance on emissions has been criticised
by environmental groups and we have the worst
record of any major EU nation when it comes
to renewable energy. This must change to
safeguard Britain and the world’s future.
We need to cut our carbon emissions to tackle
the challenge of climate change. But the
low carbon economy also provides exciting
opportunities for British businesses. We will
encourage private sector investment to put
Britain at the forefront of the green technology
revolution, creating jobs and new businesses
across the country.
Create a low carbon future
This wave of low carbon innovation we want
to unleash requires investment, so we will
create Britain’s first Green Investment Bank
– which will draw together money currently
divided across existing government initiatives,
leveraging private sector capital to finance
new green technology start-ups. We will create

green Individual Savings Accounts to help
provide the financial backing we need to create
a low carbon economy.
A credible and sustainable price for carbon
is vital if we are to see adequate and timely
investment in new electricity generation.
Whatever the carbon content of electricity
generated, operators considering new
investments in projects with a life of several
decades need to know where they stand. We
will reform the Climate Change Levy to
provide a floor price for carbon, delivering
the right climate for investment in low carbon
energy production.
We will increase the proportion of tax revenues
accounted for by environmental taxes, ensuring
that any additional revenues from new green
taxes that are principally designed as an
environmental measure to change behaviour
are used to reduce the burden of taxation
elsewhere.
Aberystwyth
Aberystwyth is an important cultural and
education centre. Aberystwyth University has
over 12,000 students and is one of the leading
universities in the country. The National
Library of Wales is based in Aberystwyth, as
are the Welsh Books Council and the offices
of the Dictionary of the Welsh language,
Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru. Aberystwyth has
a range of neighbourhoods – from Victorian
terraces to 1960s suburban semis. Over 70 per
cent of British people live in suburbs, which are
a defining feature of modern Britain. Suburbs
play a vital role in the success of Britain’s
cities, providing housing and green spaces for
millions of families. Suburbs are places where
a sense of community can flourish, and where
people raise children and play an active part in
neighbourhood groups.



Change society
Mend our broken society
Our society is broken, but together we can mend it: we can build the Big Society. A Conservative
government will make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will back the NHS,
which matters more to families than anything. We will reform education, with new schools – and
higher standards and improved discipline for all. We will tackle welfare dependency and the
causes of poverty, and fight back against crime.
change society | introduction
Despite Labour’s massive expansion of the state, many people’s quality of life is getting worse,
not better. The number of people living in poverty has risen in the last three years, and inequality
is at a record high. We have some of the worst rates of family breakdown in the world. In some
of the most deprived parts of the country, life expectancy has actually fallen. The achievement
gap at school between the richest and poorest is growing.
This terrible record of failure is not just a problem that affects our society and ruins people’s
lives. It affects our economy too, costing billions and wasting potential. It is the result of a political
approach that addresses the symptoms, rather than the underlying causes, of social breakdown;
one that relies on top-down government intervention and bureaucratic micro-management.
So we need a new approach: social responsibility, not state control; the Big Society, not big
government. Only in this way will we tackle the causes of poverty and inequality, rather than just
the symptoms. Only in this way will we transform the quality of our public services. And only in
this way will we rebuild shattered communities and repair the torn fabric of society.
So we will redistribute power from the central state to individuals, families and local
communities. We will give public sector workers back their professional autonomy. They will
be accountable to the people they serve and the results they achieve will be made transparent. If
people don’t like the service they receive they will be able to choose better alternatives. In this way,
we will create opportunities for people to take power and control over their lives. Our approach is
absolutely in line with the spirit of the age: the post-bureaucratic age.
This vision demands a cultural change across the country. Our success will depend not just on
the actions we take but on society’s response. By promoting equality and tackling discrimination,
our policies, like recognising civil partnerships as well as marriage in the tax system and helping
disabled people live independently, will give everybody the chance to play their part. This way,
we can make Britain fairer and safer; a country where opportunity is more equal.



The size, scope and role of government in
the UK has reached a point where it is now
inhibiting, not advancing, the progressive aims
of reducing poverty, fighting inequality, and
increasing general well-being. We can’t go on
pretending that government has all the answers.
Our alternative to big government is the Big
Society: a society with much higher levels of
personal, professional, civic and corporate
responsibility; a society where people come
together to solve problems and improve life
for themselves and their communities; a society
where the leading force for progress is social
responsibility, not state control.
The Big Society runs consistently through
our policy programme. Our plans to reform
public services, mend our broken society,
and rebuild trust in politics are all part of
our Big Society agenda. These plans involve
redistributing power from the state to society;
from the centre to local communities, giving
people the opportunity to take more control
over their lives.
Build the Big Society
We will use the state to help stimulate social action, helping social enterprises to deliver public
services and training new community organisers to help achieve our ambition of every adult
citizen being a member of an active neighbourhood group. We will direct funding to those groups
that strengthen communities in deprived areas, and we will introduce National Citizen Service,
initially for 16 year olds, to help bring our country together.
change society | buil d the big society
But we recognise that it is not enough to create
opportunities for people to get involved in
building the Big Society; our reform plans
require a social response in order to be
successful. So building the Big Society is not
just a question of the state stepping back and
hoping for the best: it will require an active
role for the state. The state must take action
to agitate for, catalyse and galvanise social
renewal. We must use the state to help
remake society.
Public service reform
Our public service reform programme will
enable social enterprises, charities and
voluntary groups to play a leading role in
delivering public services and tackling
deep-rooted social problems.
We will strengthen and support social
enterprises to help deliver our public service
reforms by creating a Big Society Bank, funded
from unclaimed bank assets, to provide
new finance for neighbourhood groups,
charities, social enterprises and other nongovernmental
bodies.



This will provide social enterprises with the
start-up funding and support they need to
bid for government contracts or work towards
delivering services under a payment by
results model.
Britain has a proud and long-standing
charitable tradition, and we are convinced
that the voluntary sector should play a major
part in our civic renewal. We will introduce
a fair deal on grants to give voluntary sector
organisations more stability and allow them to
earn a competitive return for providing public
services. We will work with local authorities to
promote the delivery of public services by social
enterprises, charities and the voluntary sector.
Neighbourhood groups
Our reform agenda is designed to empower
communities to come together to address local
issues. For example, we will enable parents
to start new schools, empower communities
to take over local amenities such as parks
and libraries that are under threat, give
neighbourhoods greater control of the planning
system, and enable residents to hold the police
to account in neighbourhood beat meetings.
These policies will give new powers and rights
to neighbourhood groups: the ‘little platoons’
of civil society – and the institutional building
blocks of the Big Society.
Our ambition is for every adult in the country
to be a member of an active neighbourhood
group. We will stimulate the creation and
development of neighbourhood groups, which
can take action to improve their local area. We
will use Cabinet Office budgets to fund the
training of independent community organisers
to help people establish and run neighbourhood
groups, and provide neighbourhood grants to
the UK’s poorest areas to ensure they play a
leading role in the rebuilding of civic society.
To stimulate social action further, we will:
transform the civil service • into a ‘civic
service’ by making sure that participation
in social action is recognised in civil
servants’ appraisals;
• launch an annual Big Society Day to
celebrate the work of neighbourhood groups
and encourage more people to take part
in social action;
• provide funding from the Big Society Bank
to intermediary bodies with a track record
of supporting and growing social enterprises;
and,
• develop a measure of well-being that
encapsulates the social value of state action.



National Citizen Service
Building the Big Society means encouraging
the concept of public-spirited service – the idea
that everyone should play a part in making their
communities stronger.
That is why we will introduce National Citizen
Service. The initial flagship project will provide
a programme for 16 year olds to give them a
chance to develop the skills needed to be active
and responsible citizens, mix with people
from different backgrounds, and start getting
involved in their communities.
Even in these difficult times, the British people
have demonstrated their desire to give money
and time to good causes. We will introduce
new ways to increase philanthropy, and use the
latest insights from behavioural economics to
encourage people to make volunteering and
community participation something they do
on a regular basis.
The National Lottery
We will restore the National Lottery to its
original purpose and, by cutting down on
administration costs, make sure more money
goes to good causes. The Big Lottery Fund
will focus purely on supporting social action
through the voluntary and community sector,
instead of Ministers’ pet projects as at present.
Sports, heritage and the arts will each see their
original allocations of 20 per cent of good cause
money restored.
Sport and the Olympics
We will deliver a successful Olympics that
brings lasting benefits for the country as a
whole. Part of the community sports budget
of the National Lottery will be responsible
for delivering an Olympic legacy, including
the vigorous promotion of competitive sports
through a national Olympic-style school
competition. To support high-level sport
further, we will:
work with the Scottish government • to deliver
a top-quality Commonwealth Games in
Glasgow in 2014;
• ensure that the 2013 Rugby League and
the 2015 Rugby Union World Cups are
successful; and,
• strongly support England’s bid to host the
2018 Football World Cup.



Julie Fallon
“I went to a ‘Cameron Direct’ meeting in our local town hall where David Cameron
answered questions from members of the public – and one thing he said that really
took hold with me was that he wanted Britain to be one of the most family-friendly
countries… I think that’s just a great outlook to have – how brilliant would it be if
we could achieve that? I think that the Tories have some great ideas and I believe
that their policies on family, especially on flexible working, are the best thing for
my future and for my children’s future.”
Julie Fallon lives in Llandudno, Wales, with her husband and two children



Strong families are the bedrock of a strong
society. They provide the stability and love
we need to flourish as human beings, and the
relationships they foster are the foundation on
which society is built. The warmth of a child’s
parenting is as important to their life chances as
the wealth of their upbringing.
Labour’s complacent attitude to commitment
has done untold harm, and their narrow
approach ignores the importance of
strengthening the relationships between
all family members – children, parents,
grandparents and the wider family. As a result,
Britain is one of the least family-friendly
countries in the world.
This will change with a Conservative
government. We will help families with all the
pressures they face: the lack of time, money
worries, the impact of work, concerns about
schools and crime, preventing unhealthy
influences, poor housing. We will not be neutral
on this. Britain’s families will get our full
backing across all our policies.
Make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe
We will make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will support families in the
tax and benefits system, extend flexible working and improve parental leave. We will help parents
cope with the commercialisation of childhood and give families more control over their lives.
We will support and improve Sure Start, and introduce a new universal health visiting service.
We will give targeted help to disadvantaged and dysfunctional families.
change SOCIET Y MAKE BRITAIN THE MOST FAMILYFRIENDLY
COUNTRY IN EUROPE
Reform tax and benefits to help
families and pensioners
Today, Labour’s tax and benefits system
rewards couples who split up. A Conservative
government will end the couple penalty for
all couples in the tax credit system as we make
savings from our welfare reform plans. We
will recognise marriage and civil partnerships
in the tax system in the next Parliament. This
will send an important signal that we value
couples and the commitment that people make
when they get married.
To help Britain’s families further, a
Conservative government will freeze council
tax for two years, in partnership with local
councils. This will be paid for by reducing
spending on government consultants and
advertising, and could save families and
pensioners up to £219 over two years on a
Band D bill. We will also scrap Labour’s
plans for an expensive and intrusive council
tax revaluation.



We support tax credits and will continue to
provide the range of tax credits to families,
although we can no longer justify paying
tax credits to households earning more than
£50,000. We will reform the administration of
tax credits to reduce fraud and overpayments,
which hit the poorest families hardest.
We strongly value the role older people play in
families and in society, and will not let them
suffer because of the economic mistakes of
others. That is why we have made a pledge
to pensioners to re-link the basic state pension
to earnings, and protect:
• the winter fuel payment;
• free bus passes;
• free TV licences;
• disability living allowance and attendance
allowance; and,
• the pension credit.
Give families more control over
their lives
Making Britain more family-friendly means
helping families spend more time together.
That is why we will initially extend the right to
request flexible working to every parent with
a child under the age of eighteen. We want our
government to lead from the front, so we will
extend the right to request flexible working to
all those in the public sector, recognising that
this may need to be done in stages. In addition,
we will:
• in the longer term, extend the right to request
flexible working to all, but only in the light
of experience and after full consultation
with business on how to do this in a way
which is administratively simple and without
burdening them with extra costs; and,
• oblige JobCentre Plus offices to ask employers
if their vacancies could be advertised on a
part-time or flexible basis.
We will introduce a new system of flexible
parental leave which lets parents share maternity
leave between them, while ensuring that parents
on leave can stay in touch with their employer.
We support the provision of free nursery care for
pre-school children, and we want that support
to be provided by a diverse range of providers.
A Conservative government will review the
way the childcare industry is regulated and
funded to ensure that no providers, including
childminders, are put at a disadvantage.
To give families more control over their lives,
we will put funding for relationship support
on a stable, long-term footing and make sure
couples are given greater encouragement to use
existing relationship support. We will review
family law in order to increase the use of
mediation when couples do break up, and look
at how best to provide greater access rights
to non-resident parents and grandparents.



Protect childhood
Children should be allowed to grow up at their
own pace, without excessive pressure placed
on them by businesses. We will take a series of
measures to help reverse the commercialisation
of childhood. We prefer to gain voluntary
consent to these actions but we are prepared to
legislate if necessary. We will:
prevent any marketing • or advertising
company found to be in serious breach of
rules governing marketing to children from
bidding for government advertising contracts
for three years;
• ban companies from using new peer-to-peer
marketing techniques targeted at children,
and tackle marketing on corporate websites
targeted at children;
• establish a new online system that gives
parents greater powers to take action against
irresponsible commercial activities targeted
at children; and,
• empower head teachers and governors to ban
advertising and vending machines in schools.
A new approach to early
intervention
The Conservative Party is committed to
keeping Sure Start because the network of
Children’s Centres is of enormous value to
parents across the country. But we believe Sure
Start needs to work better because the
people who need it most – disadvantaged
and dysfunctional families – are not getting
enough of the benefit.
We will take Sure Start back to its original
purpose of early intervention, increase its
focus on the neediest families, and better
involve organisations with a track record in
supporting families.
Families need the best possible advice and
support while their children are young. We will
provide 4,200 more Sure Start health visitors
– giving all parents a guaranteed level of
support before and after birth until their child
starts school. This will be paid for out of the
Department of Health budget and by refocusing
Sure Start’s peripatetic outreach services.
To improve the early interventions we make to
help families, we will:
• ensure that new Sure Start providers are paid
in part by the results they achieve;
• bring all funding for early intervention and
parenting support into one budget, to be
overseen by a single, newly-created Early
Years Support Team; and,
• set out a new approach to help families with
multiple problems.



More than three years ago, David Cameron
spelled out his priorities in three letters – NHS.
Since then, we have consistently fought to
protect the values the NHS stands for and have
campaigned to defend the NHS from Labour’s
cuts and reorganisations. As the party of the
NHS, we will never change the idea at its heart
– that healthcare in this country is free at the
point of use and available to everyone based on
need, not ability to pay.
We have a reform plan to make the changes
the NHS needs. We will decentralise power, so
that patients have a real choice. We will make
doctors and nurses accountable to patients,
not to endless layers of bureaucracy and
management. We can’t go on with an NHS that
puts targets before patients.
We will make the performance of the NHS
totally transparent by publishing information
about the kind of results that healthcare
providers are achieving, so there is no hiding
place for failure. We will increase access to
vital drugs and services, and create a greater
focus on preventing people getting ill in the
first place. This is how we will achieve our
Back the NHS
We will back the NHS. We will increase health spending every year. We will give patients more
choice and free health professionals from the tangle of politically-motivated targets that get in the
way of providing the best care. We will give patients better access to the treatments, services and
information that improve and extend lives, boost the nation’s health, and reform social care.
change society | back the nhs
ambition for the NHS to deliver some of the
best healthcare in the world.
We are the party of the NHS today because we
not only back the values of the NHS, we back
its funding and have a vision for its future.
Give patients more choice
We understand the pressures the NHS faces, so
we will increase health spending in real terms
every year. But on its own this will not be
enough to deliver the rising standards of care
that people expect. We need to allow patients
to choose the best care available, giving
healthcare providers the incentives they need to
drive up quality.
So we will give every patient the power to
choose any healthcare provider that meets NHS
standards, within NHS prices. This includes
independent, voluntary and community sector
providers. We will make patients’ choices
meaningful by:
putting patients • in charge of making
decisions about their care, including control
of their health records;



spreading the use of • the NHS tariff, so
funding follows patients’ choices; and,
• making sure good performance is rewarded
by implementing a payment by results
system, improving quality.
We will publish detailed data about the
performance of healthcare providers online, so
everyone will know who is providing a good
service and who is falling behind, and we
will measure our success on the health results
that really matter – such as improving cancer
and stroke survival rates or reducing hospital
infections.
Patients will be able to rate hospitals and
doctors according to the quality of care they
received. We will give the public a strong and
independent voice through HealthWatch, a
statutory body with the power to investigate
and support complaints.
We will strengthen the power of GPs as
patients’ expert guides through the health
system by:
• giving them the power to hold patients’
budgets and commission care on their behalf;
• linking their pay to the quality of their
results; and,
• putting them in charge of commissioning
local health services.
Trust healthcare professionals
Doctors and nurses need to be able to use
their professional judgement about what is
right for patients, instead of being forced to
follow bureaucratic processes that often put
lives at risk. That is why we will scrap the
politically-motivated targets that have no
clinical justification. We will set NHS providers
free to innovate by ensuring that they become
autonomous Foundation Trusts.
We will make sure that funding decisions are
made on the basis of need, and commissioning
decisions according to evidence-based quality
standards, by creating an independent NHS
board to allocate resources and provide
commissioning guidelines. We will ensure that
NHS staff are protected if they raise concerns
about patient safety.
NHS staff will be properly accountable to
patients for their performance, removing the
need for expensive layers of bureaucracy to
oversee the NHS. As a result, we will be able to
cut the cost of NHS administration by a third
and transfer resources to support doctors and
nurses on the frontline.



Increase access to vital drugs
and services
People want an NHS that is easy to access at
any time of day or night. We will commission
a 24/7 urgent care service in every area of
England, including GP out of hours services,
and ensure that every patient can access a GP
in their area between 8am and 8pm, seven days
a week. We will introduce a single number for
every kind of urgent care – to run in parallel
with the emergency number 999.
We will stop the forced closure of A&E and
maternity wards, so that people have better
access to local services, and give mothers a real
choice over where to have their baby, with NHS
funding following their decisions. We will
create local ‘maternity networks’ to ensure that
mothers can safely access the right care, in the
right place, at the right time.
When patients are forced to go to hospital, they
expect the highest standards of cleanliness.
But infections like MR SA now kill more
than three times as many people as are killed
on the roads each year. We will increase
the number of single rooms in hospitals, as
resources allow, helping the battle against
infection and providing safety and privacy. As
a result, we will end the scandal of mixed-sex
accommodation – which Labour have failed to
do. And we will not pay hospitals in full when a
patient is left with an avoidable infection.
NHS patients rightly expect to be among the
first in the world to access effective treatments,
but under Labour they are among the last.
We want more people to access the drugs and
treatments that would prolong or improve their
lives by reforming the way drug companies
are paid for NHS medicines. Using money
saved by the NHS through our pledge to stop
Labour’s jobs tax, we will create a Cancer Drug
Fund to enable patients to access the cancer
drugs their doctors think will help them.
To help the fight against cancer further, we will:
give thousands more • people – especially
young people – access to effective drugs
to treat rare cancers by changing the way
these drugs are commissioned;
• encourage clinical trials of innovative
techniques to diagnose and treat cancer; and,
• support the roll out of screening programmes
for common cancers.
Under Labour, fewer people are able to
see an NHS dentist. So we will introduce
a new dentistry contract that will focus on
achieving good dental health, not simply the
number of treatments achieved. This will tie
newly-qualified dentists into the NHS for five
years and allow dentists to fine people who
consistently miss appointments. These changes
will allow us to give one million more people
access to an NHS dentist and give every five
year old a dental check-up.



Take control of your care
Where possible we want to devolve control
over health budgets to the lowest possible level,
so people have more control over their health
needs. For people with a chronic illness or a
long-term condition, we will provide access to
a single budget that combines their health and
social care funding, which they can tailor to
their own needs.
The UK’s six million carers play an
indispensable role in looking after friends
or family members who need support. Not
only do they provide help to some of the most
vulnerable people in society, the unpaid work
they do contributes £87 billion worth of value
a year – sometimes at the cost of carers’
finances and even their health. We will support
carers, and those they look after, by providing
direct payments to help with care needs and
by improving access to respite care.
We will provide £10 million a year beyond 2011
to support children’s hospices in their vital
work. And so that proper support for
the most sick children and adults can
continue in the setting of their choice,
we will introduce a new per-patient funding
system for all hospices and other providers
of palliative care.
We reject Labour’s plans for a compulsory
‘death tax’ on everyone to pay for social care,
regardless of their needs. We want to create
a system which is based on choice and which
rewards the hundreds of thousands of people
who care for an elderly relative full-time. So
we will allow anyone to protect their home
from being sold to fund residential care costs
by paying a one-off insurance premium that is
entirely voluntary. Independent experts suggest
this should cost around £8,000. We will support
older people to live independently at home and
have access to the personal care they need. We
will work to design a system where people can
top up their premium – also voluntarily – to cover
the costs of receiving care in their own home.
A healthier nation
Lifestyle-linked health problems like obesity
and smoking, an ageing population, and the
spread of infectious diseases are leading to
soaring costs for the NHS. At the same time,
the difference in male life expectancy between
the richest and poorest areas in our country is
now greater than during Victorian times.
We will turn the Department of Health into
a Department for Public Health so that the
promotion of good health and prevention of
illness get the attention they need. We will
provide separate public health funding to local
communities, which will be accountable for –
and paid according to – how successful they
are in improving their residents’ health. In
addition, we will:



introduce a health premium • – weighting public
health funding towards the poorest areas with
the worst health outcomes;
• enable welfare-to-work providers and
employers to purchase services from
Mental Health Trusts; and,
• increase access to effective ‘talking’ therapies.



Sweden
Since the free schools programme was established in
Sweden, over 1,000 new schools have opened. They have
been founded by foundations, charities and others – and they
have attracted pupils by offering better discipline and higher
standards. Because any parent can take the money the Swedish
Government spends on their child’s education and choose the
school they want, standards have risen across the board as
every school does its best to satisfy parents.



Improving our school system is the most
important thing we can do to make opportunity
more equal and address our declining social
mobility. But Britain is slipping down the world
league tables in reading, Maths and Science,
and violence in the classroom is a serious
problem. We are falling behind other countries,
and there is a growing gap between the richest
and the poorest. We can’t go on like this, for the
sake of the next generations.
A Conservative government will give many
more children access to the kind of education
that is currently only available to the well-off:
safe classrooms, talented and specialist teachers,
access to the best curriculum and exams, and
smaller schools with smaller class sizes with
teachers who know the children’s names.
Better teachers and tougher
discipline
The single most important thing for a good
education is for every child to have access to
a good teacher. We will take steps to enhance
the status of the teaching profession and ensure
it attracts the best people. Schools – especially
Raise standards in schools
We will improve standards for all pupils and close the attainment gap between the richest and
poorest. We will enhance the prestige and quality of the teaching profession, and give heads and
teachers tough new powers of discipline. We will restore rigour to the curriculum and exam system
and give every parent access to a good school.
change society | raise standards in schools
struggling ones – must be able to attract the
best teachers and subject specialists, so we will
give all head teachers the power to pay good
teachers more.
We will expand Teach First and introduce
two new programmes – Teach Now, for
people looking to change career, and Troops
to Teachers, for ex-service personnel – to get
experienced, high-quality people into the
profession.
We will make it easier for teachers to deal with
violent incidents and remove disruptive pupils
or items from the classroom. We believe heads
are best placed to improve behaviour, which
is why we will stop them being overruled by
bureaucrats on exclusions.
To raise the status of teaching and toughen
school discipline further, we will:
raise the entry requirement for taxpayerfunded
primary school teacher training;
• expect new graduates to have at least a
2:2 in their degree in order to qualify for
state-funded training;



pay the student loan • repayments for top
Maths and Science graduates for as long as
they remain teachers, by redirecting some of
the current teacher training budget;
• give teachers the strongest possible
protection from false accusations; and,
• reinforce powers of discipline by
strengthening home-school behaviour
contracts.
A rigorous curriculum and
exam system
Every child who is capable of reading should
be doing so after two years in primary school.
To make this happen, we will promote the
teaching of systematic synthetic phonics and
ensure that teachers are properly trained to
teach using this method. To provide parents
with the reassurance they need that their child
is making progress, we will establish a simple
reading test at the age of six.
We will reform the National Curriculum so that
it is more challenging and based on evidence
about what knowledge can be mastered by
children at different ages. We will ensure that
the primary curriculum is organised around
subjects like Maths, Science and History.
We will encourage setting so those who are
struggling get extra help and the most able are
stretched.
Under Labour, the exam system has become
devalued. We will ensure that our exam system
is measured against the most rigorous systems
in the world. We will keep Key Stage 2 tests
and league tables. We will reform them to
make them more rigorous. We will make other
exams more robust by giving universities
and academics more say over their form and
content. We want to develop proper vocational
and technical education that engages young
people and meets the needs of modern business.
So we will establish Technical Academies
across England, starting in at least twelve cities.
People expect to be able to make choices
about the services they use, based on robust
information about the quality on offer. So a
Conservative government will reform school
league tables so that schools can demonstrate
they are stretching the most able and raising the
attainment of the less able.
To improve school standards further, we will:
• allow all state schools the freedom to offer
the same high quality international exams
that private schools offer – including giving
every pupil the chance to study separate
sciences at GCSE;
• create 20,000 additional young
apprenticeships;
• allow schools and colleges to offer
workplace training;



publish all performance • data currently kept
secret by the Department for Children,
Schools and Families; and,
• establish a free online database of exam
papers and marking schemes.
Give every parent access to
a good school
Drawing on the experience of the Swedish
school reforms and the charter school
movement in the United States, we will break
down barriers to entry so that any good
education provider can set up a new Academy
school. Our schools revolution will create a new
generation of good small schools with smaller
class sizes and high standards of discipline.
Our school reform programme is a major part
of our anti-poverty strategy, which is why
our first task will be to establish new Academy
schools in the most deprived areas of the
country. They will be beacons of excellence
in areas where school standards are
unacceptably low.
We want every child to benefit from our
reforms. So all existing schools will have
the chance to achieve Academy status, with
‘outstanding’ schools pre-approved, and we
will extend the Academy programme to
primary schools.
Education’s real power lies in its ability to
transform life chances, but we can’t go on
giving the poorest children the worst education.
That is why we will introduce a pupil
premium – extra funding for children from
disadvantaged backgrounds.
The most vulnerable children deserve the
very highest quality of care, so we will call a
moratorium on the ideologically-driven closure
of special schools. We will end the bias towards
the inclusion of children with special needs in
mainstream schools.
People have been far too ready to excuse failure
in schools. We will ensure that the schools
inspectorate Ofsted adopts a more rigorous
and targeted inspection regime, reporting on
performance only in the core areas related to
teaching and learning. And any school that is
in special measures for more than a year will
be taken over immediately by a successful
Academy provider. To give parents better
access to a good school, we will:
• give parents the power to save local schools
threatened by closure, allowing communities
the chance to take over and run good small
schools;
• make sure Academies have the freedoms that
helped to make them so successful in the first
place; and,
• ensure failing schools are inspected
more often – with the best schools visited
less frequently.



New York
New York shows that it is
possible to get a grip and cut
crime. Over the past twenty
years, serious crime in New
York has fallen by 80 per
cent, thanks to proactive
community-based policing
and the intelligent use of new
technologies and crime data.



Recorded violent crime against the person has
risen sharply under Labour, yet police officers
spend more time on paperwork than they do out
on patrol. Labour’s obsession with bureaucratic
targets and box-ticking is hindering the fight
against crime. Their string of broken promises
has undermined people’s trust. We can’t go
on with the police filling in forms instead of
fighting crime.
A Conservative government will help to mend
our broken society – by cracking down on
drink- and drug-fuelled violence, tackling
re-offending, and intervening early to stop
young people getting onto the conveyor belt
to crime – in order to reduce the causes of
crime and anti-social behaviour.
We will rebuild confidence in the criminal
justice system so that people know it is on the
side of victims and working for law-abiding
people, not criminals. And we will reform the
police, giving them back their professional
discretion – getting them out of police stations
and onto the street, fighting and preventing
Fight back against crime
We will fight back against the crime and anti-social behaviour that blights our communities.
We will take steps to reduce the causes of crime, like poverty and broken families. We will put the
criminal justice system on the side of responsible citizens, take tougher measures against knife
criminals and crack down on the binge-drinking that leads to violence. We will cut paperwork to get
police out on the street and give people democratic control over local policing. We will introduce
honesty in sentencing and pay voluntary and private providers to reduce re-offending.
change society | fight back against crime
crime – in return for making them truly
accountable to the people they serve.
Targeted measures to reduce the
causes of crime
Under Labour’s lax licensing regime,
drink-fuelled violence and disorder are a blight
on many communities. We will overhaul the
Licensing Act to give local authorities and
the police much stronger powers to remove
licences from, or refuse to grant licences to,
any premises that are causing problems.
In addition, we will:
allow councils and • the police to shut
down permanently any shop or bar found
persistently selling alcohol to children;
• double the maximum fine for under-age
alcohol sales to £20,000;
• raise taxes on those drinks linked to antisocial
drinking, while abolishing Labour’s
new ‘cider tax’ on ordinary drinkers;



ban off-licences a • nd supermarkets from
selling alcohol below cost price; and,
• permit local councils to charge more for latenight
licences to pay for additional policing.
We recognise the need for criminal sanctions
like ASBOs and fixed penalty notices, but
they are blunt instruments that often fail their
purpose of deterring people from committing
more crime. We will introduce a series
of early intervention measures, including
grounding orders, to allow the police to use
instant sanctions to deal with anti-social
behaviour without criminalising young people
unnecessarily.
Put the criminal justice system
on the side of the public
Today, almost four out of every five people
found guilty of a knife crime escape jail. We
have to send a serious, unambiguous message
that carrying a knife is totally unacceptable,
so we will make it clear that anyone convicted
of a knife crime can expect to face a prison
sentence. We will introduce mobile knife
scanners on streets and public transport, and
extend the length of custodial sentences that
can be awarded in a Magistrates’ Court from
six to twelve months.
Our criminal justice system often lets down
the victims of crime, so we will ensure that
victims and their families are better informed
about the progress of criminal proceedings
and release of offenders. So that the public
can be confident their views are accounted
for in deciding sentences, we will examine
the case for greater Parliamentary scrutiny
of sentencing guidelines. We will carry out a
fundamental review of legal aid to make it work
more efficiently, and examine ways of bringing
in alternative sources of funding.
We will change the law so that anyone acting
reasonably to stop a crime or apprehend a
criminal is not arrested or prosecuted, and we
will give householders greater legal protection
if they have to defend themselves against
intruders in their homes.
We will implement the Prisoners’ Earnings Act
1996 to allow deductions from the earnings
of prisoners in properly paid work to be paid
into the Victims’ Fund. We will use this Fund
to deliver up to fifteen new rape crisis centres
and give existing rape crisis centres stable,
long-term funding. To help stop sexual violence
before it occurs, we will ensure that the school
curriculum includes teaching young people
about sexual consent.
Reform the police
The police should be focusing on police work,
not paperwork. A Conservative government
will reduce the amount of paperwork that the
police have to deal with, starting by scrapping
the stop form entirely and reducing the burden



of stop and search procedures. Any search will
still be recorded but by an officer radioing in,
rather than filling in paperwork. To allow the
police to focus on fighting crime, we will:
amend the health and safety • laws that stand
in the way of common sense policing;
• give police the power to identify offenders in
order to protect the public and prevent crime;
• return charging discretion to the police for
minor offences; and,
• process criminals more quickly by videolinking
custody cells and courts.
Policing relies on consent. People want to
know that the police are listening to them,
and the police want to be able to focus on
community priorities, not ticking boxes.
We will replace the existing, invisible and
unaccountable police authorities and make
the police accountable to a directly-elected
individual who will set policing priorities for
local communities. They will be responsible
for setting the budget and the strategy for local
police forces, with the police retaining their
operational independence.
Giving people democratic control over
policing priorities is a huge step forward
in the empowerment of local communities,
and we will go further by giving people the
information they need to challenge their
neighbourhood police teams to cut crime.
We will oblige the police to publish detailed
local crime data statistics every month, in an
open and standardised format.
Extremists, serious criminals and others find
our borders far too easy to penetrate. That is
why we will create a dedicated Border Police
Force, as part of a refocused Serious Organised
Crime Agency, to enhance national security,
improve immigration controls, and crack
down on the trafficking of people, weapons
and drugs. We will work with police forces to
strengthen arrangements to deal with serious
crime and other cross-boundary policing
challenges, and extend collaboration between
forces to deliver better value for money.
Prisons with a purpose
In the last three years, 80,000 criminals have
been released early from prison because the
Government failed to build enough places.
We are determined that early release will not
be introduced again, so we will redevelop the
prison estate and increase capacity as necessary
to stop it. Under Labour, the number of
foreign criminals in our prisons has more than
doubled. We will extend early deportation of
foreign national prisoners to reduce further the
pressure on our prison population.
Many people feel that sentencing in Britain
is dishonest and misleading. So we will
introduce a system where the courts can
specify minimum and maximum sentences for



certain offenders. These prisoners will only be
able to leave jail after their minimum sentence
is served by having earned their release, not
simply by right.
At the moment, many prisoners leave jail
and lapse back into a life of drink, drugs and
re-offending. We will never bring our crime
rate down or start to reduce the costs of crime
until we properly rehabilitate ex-prisoners.
So, with a Conservative government, when
offenders leave prison, they will be trained and
rehabilitated by private and voluntary sector
providers, under supervision. We will use the
same approach that lies behind our welfare
reform plans – payment by results – to cut
re-offending, with organisations paid using
savings made in the criminal justice system
from the resulting lower levels of crime.
Drug and alcohol addiction are behind many
of the crimes that are committed on our
streets, but the treatment that too many addicts
receive just maintains their habits. We will
give courts the power to use abstinence-based
Drug Rehabilitation Orders to help offenders
kick drugs once and for all. We will introduce
a system of temporary bans on new ‘legal
highs’ while health issues are considered by
independent experts.
To reform our system of rehabilitation further,
we will:
apply our payment by • results reforms to
the youth justice system;
• engage with specialist organisations to
provide education, mentoring and drug
rehabilitation programmes to help young
offenders go straight; and,
• pilot a scheme to create Prison and
Rehabilitation Trusts so that just one
organisation is responsible for helping
to stop a criminal re-offending.



Brighton
Brighton and Hove is one of Britain’s
most creative and diverse cities. The
city hosts over 50 festivals each year,
including England’s largest annual arts
festival, and boasts some of the top live
performance venues in the country.
It is also home to a large number of
creative industry companies, including
some of Britain’s leading digital media
businesses. Brighton and Hove also
has the highest proportion of same-sex
households of any city in the UK, and the
annual Pride Festival attracts more than
120,000 visitors to the city each year.



Change politics



A new agenda for a new politics
The Conservative Party has led the way in sorting out the mess of MPs’ expenses. In government
we will go further, by cutting the size of Parliament, cutting the scope of Whitehall, and cutting
the cost of politics. We will make politics more local, more transparent and more accountable.
We intend to build a new political system that serves people rather than politicians. Together,
we can change our politics for the better.
The events of recent months have revealed the size of the fissures in our political system.
Millions of people in this country are at best detached from democracy, at worst angry and
disillusioned. This endangers our ability to work together to solve our common problems. Just
putting this down to the shocking revelations of the expenses scandal would be a great mistake.
MPs’ expenses might have been the trigger for the public’s anger, but this political crisis is driven
by a deeper sense of frustration – that people have too little control over the decisions that affect
their daily lives.
The top-down model of power that exists in Britain today is completely out of date. The
argument that has applied for well over a century – that in every area of life we need people at
the centre to make sense of the world for us and take decisions on our behalf – has collapsed. We
now live in an age when technology can put information that was previously held by a few into
the hands of the many. This is an age of personal freedom and choice, when culture and debate are
shaped by a multitude of voices. But politics has not caught up with this new age. Instead of giving
people more power over their lives, we have a government intent on taking it away.
We believe in people power – and today the information revolution gives us the practical tools
to realise that philosophy. So we plan to change Britain with a sweeping redistribution of power:
from the state to citizens; from the government to Parliament; from Whitehall to communities;
from Brussels to Britain; from bureaucracy to democracy. Taking power away from the political
elite and handing it to the man and woman in the street. Using decentralisation, accountability
and transparency, we will weaken the old political elites, give people power, fix our broken politics
and restore people’s faith that if we act together things can change. This is a new agenda for
a new politics.



Shaun Bailey
“We need a new kind of politics in this
country, a politics where people join because
they want to do something, not because they
want to be someone. We need to reverse the
relationship between politicians and people
so that it’s the people demanding respect
from politicians, not the other way around.
I’ve spent my career working with and for
the people of my community, and now I’m
hoping to be fighting for that community in
Parliament. This manifesto is a call to action
for all of us to take control and do our bit in
our communities.”
Shaun Bailey is a youth worker and is the Conservative
candidate for Hammersmith and Shepherd’s Bush



It is vital that we act quickly and decisively
to restore the reputation of politics. Too much
unacceptable behaviour has gone unchecked
for too long, from excessive expenses to
sleazy lobbying practices. The people of
Britain have looked on in horror as revelations
have stripped away the dignity of Parliament,
leaving millions of voters detached from the
political process, devoid of trust in the political
classes, and disillusioned with our system
of government.
We will act rapidly to push through farreaching
reforms to restore ethics to politics
and revive the electorate’s faith in politicians.
It will take nothing less than a deep clean of the
political system in Westminster to root out the
sleaze and dispel suspicion. We will start by
cleaning up the expenses system to ensure
MPs live by the same standards as the people
who give them their jobs, and by curbing the
way in which former Ministers have secured
lobbying jobs by exploiting their contacts.
But that is just the start. We will also cut
Ministers’ pay and reduce the number of
MPs in Parliament. Then we will go further,
Make politics more accountable
We will clean up politics: the expenses, the lobbying and problems with party funding. We will cut
the cost of Parliament, cut the number of MPs and cut Ministers’ pay. We will give citizens direct
control over what goes on in Westminster, make government more accountable and safeguard the
independence of the civil service.
far further, since the expenses scandal was just
the trigger for a deeper sense of frustration.
We promise a total overhaul of our system of
government, so that power is passed from the
politicians at Westminster back to the people of
Britain. But this is the very least that is needed
to fix our broken political system.
Clean up Westminster
The political crisis was triggered by the scandal
of MPs’ expenses. We were the Party that
insisted that MPs’ expenses were published
online, and we have supported the independent
proposals to clean up the House of Commons.
We proposed legislation so that anyone
wanting to be a member of either the House
of Commons or the House of Lords will need
to be treated as a full UK taxpayer. But much,
much more is needed to clean up our politics
and restore public trust.
At the moment, there is no way that local
constituents can remove an MP found
guilty of serious wrongdoing until there is a
general election. That is why a Conservative
government will introduce a power of ‘recall’



to allow electors to kick out MPs, a power
that will be triggered by proven serious
wrongdoing. And we will introduce
a Parliamentary Privilege Act to make clear
that privilege cannot be abused by MPs to
evade justice.
The cost of politics has spiralled out of
control. We will cut the perks and bureaucracy
associated with Parliament to save over
£100 million a year. We will consult with
the Independent Parliamentary Standards
Authority on how to move away from the
generous final-salary pension system for MPs.
The public are concerned about the influence
of money on politics, whether it is from trade
unions, individuals, or the lobbying industry.
We will seek an agreement on a comprehensive
package of reform that will encourage
individual donations and include an acrosstheboard cap on donations. This will mark the
end of the big donor era and the problems it has
sometimes entailed.
A Conservative government will introduce
new measures to ensure that the contacts and
knowledge Ministers gain while being paid by
the public to serve the public are not unfairly
used for private gain. We will:
ensure that ex-Ministers • are banned from
lobbying government for two years after
leaving office;
• ensure that ex-Ministers have to seek advice
on the business posts they take up for ten
years after leaving office;
• rewrite the Ministerial Code to make clear
that any former Minister who breaks the
rules on appointments will be forced to
give up some or all of their Ministerial
pension; and,
• introduce new rules to stop central
government bodies using public money
to hire lobbyists to lobby other
government bodies.
The lobbying industry must regulate itself to
ensure its practices are transparent – if it does
not, then we will legislate to do so.
Give citizens more power
People have been shut out of Westminster
politics for too long. Having a single vote every
four or five years is not good enough – we need
to give people real control over how they are
governed. So, with a Conservative government,
any petition that secures 100,000 signatures
will be eligible for formal debate in Parliament.
The petition with the most signatures will
enable members of the public to table a Bill
eligible to be voted on in Parliament. And we
will introduce a new Public Reading Stage
for Bills to give the public an opportunity to
comment on proposed legislation online.



Labour have meddled shamelessly with
the electoral system to try to gain political
advantage. A Conservative government will
ensure every vote will have equal value by
introducing ‘fair vote’ reforms to equalise the
size of constituency electorates, and conduct a
boundary review to implement these changes
within five years. We will swiftly implement
individual voter registration, giving everyone
the right to cast their vote in person and making
it easier for UK citizens living overseas to vote.
We support the first-past-the-post system for
Westminster elections because it gives voters
the chance to kick out a government they are
fed up with. We will work to build a consensus
for a mainly-elected second chamber to replace
the current House of Lords, recognising that an
efficient and effective second chamber should
play an important role in our democracy and
requires both legitimacy and public confidence.
Make government more
accountable and representative
Because we are serious about redistributing
power, we will restore the balance between the
government and Parliament, by:
establishing • a Backbench Business
Committee to give the House of Commons
more control over its own timetable;
• allowing MPs the time to scrutinise law
effectively;
• providing more free votes, and protecting
the principle that issues of conscience – like
abortion – remain subject to a free vote; and,
• making the use of the Royal Prerogative
subject to greater democratic control so that
Parliament is properly involved in all big
national decisions.
We will scrap Labour’s failed target regime and
instead require every department to publish
a business plan, with senior management
accountable to more rigorous departmental
boards for their performance. We will make
it easier to reward the best civil servants and
remove the least effective. We will reform the
Civil Service Compensation Scheme to bring it
more into line with practice in the private sector.
We will put a limit on the number of special
advisers and protect the impartiality of the
civil service.
Rebuilding trust in politics means making our
political system better reflect the people it is
meant to represent. We will introduce a £1
million fund to help people with disabilities
who want to become MPs, councillors or other
elected officials with the extra costs they face
in running for office. This will be funded
from the existing budget of the Government
Equalities Office.



Government has been far too profligate for
far too long. Billions are wasted each year on
pointless bureaucracy and failed projects while
taxpayers are left to foot the bill. The explosion
of unaccountable quangos, public sector ‘nonjobs’
and costly bureaucracy is an indictment of
Labour’s reckless approach to spending other
people’s money. Once again, it undermines
public trust in the political process.
We understand that people want government
to be more effective in what it does, and to do
it for less money. That means transforming
the way the state goes about its business,
using decentralisation, accountability and
transparency to reduce dramatically the cost
of government. And, because sunlight is the
best disinfectant, we will bring the operation of
government out into the open so that everyone
can see whether we are delivering good value
for money.
Publish data so the public can
hold government to account
Drawing inspiration from administrations
around the world which have shown that being
transparent can transform the effectiveness of
Make politics more transparent
We will publish details of the money government spends and the people it employs. People will
have a right to government data to make the performance of the state transparent. We will cut the
unaccountable quango state and root out waste.
government, we will create a powerful new
right to government data, enabling the public to
request – and receive – government datasets in
an open and standardised format. Independent
estimates suggest this could provide a £6
billion boost to the UK economy. We will open
up Whitehall recruitment by publishing central
government job vacancies online, saving costs
and increasing transparency.
A Conservative government will bring in new
measures to enable the public to scrutinise
the government’s accounts to see whether it
is providing value for money. All data will be
published in an open and standardised format.
We will:
require public bodies • to publish online the
job titles of every member of staff and the
salaries and expenses of senior officials paid
more than the lowest salary permissible
in Pay Band 1 of the Senior Civil Service
pay scale, and organograms that include all
positions in those bodies;
• require anyone paid more than the Prime
Minister in the public sector to have their
salary signed off by the Treasury;



require senior civil • servants to publish
online details of expense claims and
meetings with lobbyists;
• apply these transparency principles to
local government, with the threshold for
publication of spending items and contracts
set at £500, and for the publication of salaries
the same as at the national level; and,
• give councillors the power to vote on
large salary packages for unelected
council officials.
Curtail the quango state
Under Labour, the quango state has flourished.
Government figures show that there are over
700 unelected bodies spending £46 billion
every year, but this does not even include the
range of advisory bodies, public corporations,
taskforces and regional government bodies that
have sprung up under Labour. We believe that
Ministers should be responsible for government
policy, not unelected bureaucrats. Any quangos
that do not perform a technical function or a
function that requires political impartiality,
or act independently to establish facts, will be
abolished. To increase the scrutiny of quangos,
we will:
• give Select Committees the right to hold
confirmation hearings for major public
appointments, including the heads
of quangos;
• examine the case for giving Select
Committees the power to prevent increases
in quango budgets; and,
• ensure that the National Audit Office has full
access to the BB C’s accounts.
Reduce the cost of procurement
This government has a dreadful record of
managing procurement, with billions of pounds
wasted on mismanaged projects. We will tackle
wasteful government procurement projects by:
• strengthening the role of the Chief
Information Officer to get a grip on
government ICT projects;
• introducing a series of changes to ICT
procurement to deliver better value for money;
• appointing senior private sector nonexecutives
to departmental boards to deliver
better value for money;
• publishing in full government contracts for
goods and services worth over £25,000; and,
• increasing the accountability of EU spending
by publishing details of every UK project
that receives over £25,000 of EU funds.



Over the last forty years, governments of
all colours have been guilty of weakening
local government. But what was a gradual
centralisation has accelerated dramatically
under Labour. Bureaucratic control has
replaced democratic accountability. The
wishes of local people are second-guessed
by bureaucrats; the activities of councils are
micro-managed by unelected quangos. This
hoarding of power by distant politicians and
unaccountable officials in Whitehall has
damaged society by eroding trust.
We believe that the more responsibility you
give people, the more responsibly they behave.
That is why we are so determined to give
people much more power and control over
their lives. Citizens themselves should have a
direct say over how they are governed – but
not through bureaucratic consultations or
phoney citizens juries, which never change
anything. We need a totally different approach
to governing, one that involves people in
making the decisions that affect them. This is
what we call collaborative democracy – people
Make politics more local
We will put neighbourhoods in charge of planning the way their communities develop, with
incentives in favour of sustainable development. We will make it easier for everyone to get onto
the housing ladder. We will give individuals and local government much more power, allow
communities to take control of vital services, and give people the chance to have a powerful,
elected mayor in England’s largest cities.
taking the kind of powers that until now have
been exercised only by governments. So
we want to pass power down to people – to
individuals where we can. But it is not always
possible to give power to individuals, and in
those cases we need to push power down to the
most appropriate local level: neighbourhood,
community and local government.
Put communities in charge
of planning
The planning system is vital for a strong
economy, for an attractive and sustainable
environment, and for a successful democracy.
A Conservative government will introduce a
new ‘open source’ planning system. This will
mean that people in each neighbourhood will
be able to specify what kind of development
they want to see in their area. These
neighbourhood plans will be consolidated into
a local plan.



We will abolish the entire bureaucratic and
undemocratic tier of regional planning,
including the Regional Spatial Strategies and
building targets.
Developers will have to pay a tariff to the
local authority to compensate the community
for loss of amenity and costs of additional
infrastructure. The tariff will replace the
payments and levies on development that have
grown up under Labour. A portion of this tariff
will be kept by the neighbourhoods in which a
given development takes place, providing clear
incentives for communities which go for growth.
Significant local projects, like new housing
estates, will have to be designed through a
collaborative process that has involved the
neighbourhood. Immediate neighbours will
have a new role – with a faster approvals
process for planning applications where
neighbours raise no objections.
At the national level, for all forms of
development, we will publish and present
to Parliament for debate a simple and
consolidated national planning framework,
which will set out national economic and
environmental priorities.
To give communities greater control over
planning, we will:
abolish the power of planning • inspectors
to rewrite local plans;
• amend the ‘Use Classes Order’ so that people
can use buildings for any purpose allowed in
the local plan;
• limit appeals against local planning decisions
to cases that involve abuse of process or
failure to apply the local plan;
• encourage county councils and unitary
authorities to compile infrastructure plans;
• give local planning authorities and other
public authorities a duty to co-operate with
one another; and,
• allow neighbourhoods to stop the practice of
‘garden grabbing’.
Deliver more affordable homes
We want to create a property-owning
democracy where everyone has the chance
to own their own home. That is why we will
permanently raise the stamp duty threshold to
£250,000 for first-time buyers, meaning nine
out of ten of them will pay no tax on their first
home purchase.
Communities should benefit when they choose
to develop sustainably, so we will match
pound-for-pound the council tax receipts that
local authorities receive from new homes to
encourage sensitive local development. We
will create new local housing trusts to allow
communities to grant planning permission
for new housing within villages and towns



– so that the benefits of development remain
within the local area. We will also abolish
Home Information Packs, which have made
a significant contribution to problems in our
housing market.
A Conservative government will make it easier
for social tenants to own or part-own their
home. We will:
introduce a ‘ • foot on the ladder’
programme to offer an equity stake to
good social tenants, which can be cashed
in when they move out of social rented
accommodation;
• pilot a new ‘right to move’ scheme and
introduce a nationwide social home swap
programme, so social tenants can transfer
their tenancy to another home or part of the
country; and,
• respect the tenures and rents of social
housing tenants.
We will implement a range of measures
to address the problems of the homeless,
including introducing more accurate street
counts and ensuring a Minister in each relevant
department has homelessness in their brief.
Give people more power and
control over their lives
We have set out our plans to give more power
to people over the way they are policed, the
schools their children go to and the hospitals
they are treated in. But, in addition, we want to
give individuals more direct control over how
they are governed. So, mirroring our reforms
at the national level, we will give residents the
power to instigate local referendums on any
local issue if 5 per cent of the local population
sign up, and they will also be able to veto any
proposed high council tax increases. We will
stop Labour’s plans to impose supplementary
business rates on firms if a majority do not give
their consent.
Nothing underlines the powerlessness that
many communities feel more than the loss
of essential services, like post offices and
pubs, because of decisions made by distant
bureaucrats. Our new ‘community right to
buy’ scheme will give local people the power
to protect any community assets that are
threatened with closure. In addition, we will:
• give people a ‘right to bid’ to run any
community service instead of the state; and,
• reform the governance arrangements in
football to enable co-operative ownership
models to be established by supporters.
We will give democratically accountable local
government much greater power to improve
their citizens’ lives by:
• giving local councils a ‘general power of
competence’, so that they have explicit
authority to do what is necessary to improve
their communities;



ending ring-fencing so • that funding can be
spent on local priorities;
• scrapping the hundreds of process targets
Labour have imposed on councils;
• ending the bureaucratic inspection regime
that stops councils focusing on residents’
main concerns;
• scrapping Labour’s uncompleted plans to
impose unwieldy and expensive unitary
councils and to force the regionalisation of
the fire service;
• ending the ‘predetermination rules’ that
prevent councillors speaking up about
issues that they have campaigned on; and,
• encouraging the greater use of ward budgets
for councillors.
We have seen that a single municipal leader
can inject dynamism and ambition into their
communities. So, initially, we will give the
citizens in each of England’s twelve largest
cities the chance of having an elected mayor.
Big decisions should be made by those who
are democratically accountable, not by remote
and costly quangos. We will abolish the
Government Office for London as part of our
plan to devolve more power downwards to the
London Boroughs and the Mayor of London.
Decentralising control must go hand in hand
with creating much greater transparency in
local government. Power without information
is not enough. We will implement fully
the Sustainable Communities Act, and
reintroduce the Sustainable Communities Act
(Amendment) Bill as government legislation, to
give people greater information on, and control
over, what is being spent by each government
agency in their area.
Our plans to decentralise power will only
work properly if there is a strong, independent
and vibrant local media to hold local authorities
to account. We will sweep away the rules that
stop local newspapers owning other local
media platforms and create a new network
of local television stations. And we will tighten
the rules on taxpayer-funded publicity spending
by town halls.



Labour have subjected Britain’s historic
freedoms to unprecedented attack. They
have trampled on liberties and, in their place,
compiled huge databases to track the activities
of millions of perfectly innocent people,
giving public bodies extraordinary powers to
intervene in the way we live our lives.
The impact of this has been profound and farreaching.
Trust has been replaced by suspicion.
The database state is a poor substitute for the
human judgement essential to the delivery of
public services. Worse than that, it gives people
false comfort that an infallible central state is
looking after their best interests. But the many
scandals of lost data, leaked documents and
database failures have put millions at risk. It is
time for a new approach to protecting our liberty.
Protect our freedoms
Labour’s approach to our personal privacy is
the worst of all worlds – intrusive, ineffective
and enormously expensive. We will scrap ID
cards, the National Identity Register and the
Contactpoint database. To protect our freedoms
from state encroachment and encourage
greater social responsibility, we will replace the
Restore our civil liberties
We will scale back Labour’s database state and protect the privacy of the public’s information.
We will introduce a balanced approach to the retention of people’s DNA and reform the criminal
records system so it protects children without destroying trust.
Human Rights Act with a UK Bill of Rights.
We will review and reform libel laws to protect
freedom of speech, reduce costs and discourage
libel tourism.
Wherever possible, we believe that personal
data should be controlled by individual citizens
themselves. We will strengthen the powers
of the Information Commissioner to penalise
any public body found guilty of mismanaging
data. We will take further steps to protect
people from unwarranted intrusion by the state,
including:
cutting back intrusive powers • of entry into
homes, which have been massively extended
under Labour;
• curtailing the surveillance powers that allow
some councils to use anti-terrorism laws to
spy on people making trivial mistakes or
minor breaches of the rules;
• requiring Privacy Impact Assessments of
any proposal that involves data collection
or sharing; and,
• ensuring proper Parliamentary scrutiny
of any new powers of data-sharing.



The indefinite retention of innocent people’s
DNA is unacceptable, yet DNA data provides
a useful tool for solving crimes. We will legislate
to make sure that our DNA database is used
primarily to store information about those who
are guilty of committing crimes rather than
those who are innocent. We will collect the
DNA of all existing prisoners, those under
state supervision who have been convicted of
an offence, and anyone convicted of a serious
recordable offence. We pushed the Government
to end the permanent retention of innocent
people’s DNA , and we will change the guidance
to give people on the database who have been
wrongly accused of a minor crime an automatic
right to have their DNA withdrawn.
We believe that people working in positions
of trust with children should go through a
proper criminal record check. But Labour’s
new system goes too far. So we will review
the criminal records and ‘vetting and barring’
regime and scale it back to common sense levels.
The Hunting Act has proved unworkable.
A Conservative government will give Parliament
the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act
on a free vote, with a government bill in
government time.



In recent years, we have been hearing things
that we have not heard for a long time: people
in Scotland saying they want to leave the UK,
and some people responding with ‘let them
go’. Labour’s constitutional vandalism has
weakened Parliament, undermined democracy
and brought the integrity of the ballot into
question. Our unbalanced devolution settlement
has caused separatism to gather momentum in
Scotland, and separatists have propped up
a weakened Labour Party in Wales.
The Conservative Party is passionate about the
Union and we will never do anything to put it
at risk. And, because of the new political force
we have created with the Ulster Unionists, we
are proud that at the next election we will be the
only party fielding candidates in every part of
the UK.
Support devolution
We support the changes proposed by
the Calman Commission for clarifying
the devolution settlement and creating a
relationship of mutual respect between
Westminster and Holyrood:
Strengthen the Union
We are a unionist party and we will not put the Union at risk. But we support devolution and are
committed to making it work for all countries. We will take forward the proposals of the Calman
Commission, grant a referendum on greater powers for the Welsh Assembly, and support the
devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. We will rebalance the unfairness in the voting system
for devolved issues in Parliament.
The Prime Minister and other Ministers
will go to Holyrood for questioning on
a regular basis.
• The Scottish Parliament should have more
responsibility for raising the money it spends.
We will produce our own White Paper by
May 2011 to set out how we will deal with
the issues raised by Calman, and we will
legislate to implement those proposals
within the next Parliament.
We will not stand in the way of the referendum
on further legislative powers requested by
the Welsh Assembly. The people of Wales
will decide the outcome and Conservatives
will have a free vote. But our priority
remains getting people back into work and
strengthening the Welsh economy. So we will
seek ways to work with the Welsh Assembly
Government to increase economic growth and
improve people’s quality of life.
In Northern Ireland, we strongly support
the political institutions established over the
past decade and we are committed to making



devolution work. We will continue to promote
peace, stability and economic prosperity
and work to bring Northern Ireland back
into the mainstream of UK politics. We will
produce a government paper examining the
mechanism for changing the corporation tax
rate in Northern Ireland, in order to attract
significant new investment. And we will stop
the practice of ‘double-jobbing’, whereby
elected representatives sit in both Westminster
and Stormont.
Labour have refused to address the so-called
‘West Lothian Question’: the unfair situation
of Scottish MPs voting on matters which
are devolved. A Conservative government will
introduce new rules so that legislation referring
specifically to England, or to England and
Wales, cannot be enacted without the consent
of MPs representing constituencies of those
countries.

Strangford Lough, County Down
Farming is at the heart of the rural economy, and a
significant cultural influence in British life. Over half
a million people are employed in the farming industry,
which makes use of three quarters of the UK’s land area
and generates over £4 billion of economic income for the
UK each year. Organic farming has become increasingly
important in recent years, with over 5,000 organic farms
now occupying 700,000 hectares of land. In Northern
Ireland, farming’s share of employment and economic
activity is larger than in any other part of the UK.



Protect the
environment



Vote blue, go green
A Conservative government will cut carbon emissions and rebuild our energy security. We will
make it easier for people to go green, with incentives for people to do the right thing. We will
protect our precious habitats and natural resources, and promote a sustainable farming industry.
We will fulfil our responsibility to hand on a richer and more sustainable natural environment
to future generations.
We have a vision of a greener Britain. It is a country that leads the world in the market for green
goods and services. A new hi-tech manufacturing sector and a new Green Investment Bank help
create new jobs, wealth and growth. Our cars run on electricity and high speed trains take us across
the country in less time than it takes to get across the capital. This is a country which has become
the world’s first low carbon economy.
In this vision, our homes require less energy and more of the energy we produce comes from
renewable sources. Our countryside is better cared for, we conserve more natural habitats, and
we create new green spaces and plant many more trees. Our landscape is protected and our wildlife
is enjoyed by more people of all ages. It is a greener and more pleasant land for all its citizens.
This is a Conservative vision for our future, and it is based on Conservative values. We believe
that it is our responsibility to create a clean and healthy environment to pass on to our children.
That is why we have put green issues back at the heart of our politics and that is why they will be
at the heart of our government.
Instead of using rules and regulations to impose a centralised worldview, we will go with the
grain of human nature, creating new incentives and market signals which reward people for doing
the right thing. Instead of pulling bureaucratic levers from above telling people what they can’t do,
we will provide people with the information they need to make more responsible choices. Instead
of holding businesses back by imposing unfair retrospective stealth taxes, we will unleash the
power of green enterprise and promote resource efficiency to generate thousands of green jobs.
This is how we will live up to our responsibility to be the greenest government in our history.



Freiburg
Freiburg in Germany is a world leader in
environmental sustainability. Solar panels have
been installed across the city – on schools,
churches and private houses, and even on the
sports stadium and the City Hall. Over the past
30 years, 500km of bike lanes and 9,000 bike
parking sites have been put in place and, as a
result, Freiburg now has the lowest car usage
of any city in Germany. Freiburg also has one
of the highest recycling rates of any city in the
world, which has been achieved by changing
social norms and providing facilities that make
it as easy as possible for people to recycle.
This emphasis on sustainability has had an
economic benefit too: Freiburg is home to 1,500
green technology companies, which employ
over 10,000 people and generate hundreds of
millions of euros for the local economy.



Labour’s failure on climate change has been
stark. Strong rhetoric has not been matched
by effective action – it took the longest and
deepest recession for sixty years for Labour to
achieve any significant reduction in the UK’s
carbon emissions. We need to generate 15 per
cent of our energy from renewables by 2020,
but we have one of the worst records of any EU
nation when it comes to renewable energy. Our
national security is threatened by a looming
energy crunch in which a third of our electricity
generating capacity will close, and most of our
gas will need to be imported by 2020.
Yet Britain is uniquely placed to be the world’s
first low carbon economy: we have the natural
resources to generate wind and wave power,
a skilled workforce trained in the energy
industry, a hi-tech manufacturing sector and a
green financial centre in the City of London.
We urgently need to make this transition
in order to strengthen our economy, help
guarantee our energy security and protect our
environment for future generations.
Combat climate change
We will reduce carbon emissions in line with our international commitments. We will promote
small- and large-scale low carbon energy production, including nuclear, wind, clean coal and
biogas. We will safeguard our energy security by ensuring there is sufficient spare capacity in
the energy system. We will make it easier to go green, including through a ‘Green Deal’ to cut
household energy bills.
Ambitious goals for reducing
emissions
Climate change is a global phenomenon, and
that means the world must work together to
reduce harmful emissions. A Conservative
government will work towards an ambitious
global deal that will limit emissions and make
available substantial financial resources for
adaptation and mitigation.
As part of our commitment to move towards
a low carbon future, we can confirm our aim
of reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent
by 2050. In government, we will lead from the
front by delivering a 10 per cent cut in central
government emissions within twelve months
and by working with local authorities and
others to deliver emissions reductions.



Promote low carbon energy
production
The way our energy is produced and
transmitted is stuck in the last century. A
Conservative government will transform this
‘dumb’, unresponsive network and create an
‘electricity internet’ – a highly interactive
network, based on a new smart grid that will
interact with smart meters in people’s homes,
to manage supply and demand. This will allow
a huge increase in renewable power, and far
greater choice for consumers.
To limit harmful emissions from UK power
stations, we will take steps to encourage new
low carbon energy production, including:
introducing an Emissions • Performance
Standard to limit the levels of greenhouse
gases our power stations produce;
• clearing the way for new nuclear power
stations – provided they receive no public
subsidy;
• creating four carbon capture and storageequipped
plants, taking coal – one of the
most polluting fuels of all – and transforming
it into a low carbon fuel of the future;
• delivering an offshore electricity grid in
order to support the development of a
new generation of offshore wind power,
and establishing at least two Marine
Energy Parks;
• giving local authorities the power to establish
new district heating networks which use
biogas and other low carbon fuels;
• allowing communities that host renewable
energy projects like wind farms to keep the
additional business rates they generate for six
years; and,
• giving incentives for smaller-scale energy
generation, including capturing heat that is
currently wasted.
Safeguard the UK’s energy
security
Britain has had no clear energy policy for
thirteen years. A succession of eleven energy
Ministers and eight Secretaries of State with
responsibility for energy has left our policy
muddled and put our energy security at
risk. Britain needs an energy policy that is
clear, consistent and stable. That means that
Ministers will be unambiguously responsible
for determining energy policy and delivering
an Annual Energy Statement to Parliament
to set a clear direction for energy policy. To
safeguard our energy security, we will reform
the energy regulator Ofgem so that:
• it focuses on executing energy policy;
• it is tasked with monitoring the spare
capacity in the energy market and making
provisions for additional capacity where
required; and,



its competition 
• policy and consumer
protection powers pass to the Office of
Fair Trading.
As a result, we will cut the number of quangos
intervening in the energy market.
Labour’s just-in-time approach to energy
supply has left us badly exposed to events
outside our control. We will work to diversify
the sources of the gas we need, secure longterm
contracts and increase storage capacity to
guarantee supplies throughout the year.
Help people go green
Rising energy costs hit families hard, so we
will create a ‘Green Deal’, giving every home
up to £6,500 worth of energy improvement
measures – with more for hard-to-treat homes
– paid for out of savings made on fuel bills over
25 years.
We will increase consumers’ control over
their energy costs by ensuring that every
energy bill provides information on how to
move to the cheapest tariff offered by their
supplier and how their energy usage compares
to similar households.
We will improve the energy efficiency
of everyday appliances by drawing on
the experience of the ‘top runner’ scheme
from Japan.
To help further, we will:
• ensure that 10 per cent of the staff directly

Conservatives understand the inherent value
of conserving things, and we know the
importance of ensuring that we provide a
good quality of life for future generations. Our
natural environment has been degraded and
urgent action is needed to address the loss of
vital ecosystems in the face of climate change
and development. Labour have relied too much
on regulation and top-down targets that have
failed to halt biodiversity loss.
We need to act now to enhance biodiversity,
protect our countryside and marine
environment, and secure the vital eco-systems
that sustain life on land, in our rivers and in
our seas. A Conservative government will take
a broad approach to improving the natural
environment as a whole, so that we can ensure
a secure future for the natural world where vital
ecological assets are protected and resources
are used more responsibly.
Conserve wildlife
Too many animals remain at risk of extinction,
and climate change will put even more pressure
on endangered species and precious habitats.
Conserve and enhance the natural environment
We will protect and improve the UK’s natural environment, and pioneer new schemes to improve
conservation. We will push for reform of the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies to
promote sustainable farming and fishing. We will promote high animal welfare standards and
ensure that government procures locally-produced food wherever possible. We will work towards
a zero-waste society.


protect the environment CONSERVE AND ENHANCE THE
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
We will support the strongest protection for
endangered species and work to protect vital
habitats from destruction. We will tackle the
smuggling and illegal trade in wildlife through
our new Border Police Force.
We will fight for wholesale reform of the
Common Fisheries Policy to encourage
sustainable practices, give communities a
greater say over the future of their fishing
industries, and bring an end to the scandal
of fish discards. We will take forward the
Marine and Coastal Access Act and ensure that
its conservation measures are implemented
effectively, including the creation of Marine
Conservation Zones.
We will be equally vigilant in ensuring the
welfare of animals. We will promote the
highest standards of farm animal welfare.
We will work to reduce the use of animals in
scientific research. We will promote responsible
pet ownership by introducing effective codes
of practice under the Animal Welfare Act, and
target irresponsible owners of dangerous dogs.



To give wildlife greater protection, we will:
firmly oppose any resumption • of commercial
whaling and do all we can to ensure that the
international moratorium stays in place;
• press for a total ban on ivory sales and the
destruction of existing stockpiles; and,
• promote new green spaces and wildlife
corridors to help animals adapt and thrive
in the face of climate change.
Protect habitats
The natural world faces great pressure from
development and climate change. We will
produce a White Paper on protecting the
natural environment, including a focus on
restoring habitat. We will pioneer a new system
of conservation credits to protect habitats.
We will maintain national Green Belt
protection, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty (AONBs), National Parks, Sites
of Special Scientific Interest and other
environmental designations which protect
the character of our country’s landscape.
In addition, we will:
• review the governance arrangements for
National Parks and AONB s to ensure
that they are more accountable to local
communities; and,
• work to reduce litter, which spoils too much
of our countryside and urban environment.
Since 1997, the area of new woodland created
in England each year has more than halved.
In addition to ongoing woodland creation, we
will launch a national tree planting campaign,
planting up to one million new trees in the next
Parliament. We will tackle illegal logging by:
• pressing for financial support from within
a reformed EU budget to be given to
developing countries to halt deforestation;
• pressing for only legally-harvested timber
and timber products to be made available
on the market; and,
• introducing a new criminal offence under
UK law for the import and possession of
illegal timber.
Promote sustainable and
productive farming practices
Our farmland is a national resource for future
generations and the foundation of our food
security. We will prevent development on the
most fertile farmland, in all but exceptional
circumstances. To promote sustainable farming
practices further, we will:
• support the Campaign for the Farmed
Environment and seek to create a more
effective system of environmental
stewardship;
• ensure that consumers have the right to
choose non-GM foods through clear labelling;



not permit any commercial • planting of GM
crops until and unless it has been assessed as
safe for people and the environment; and,
• develop a legally-binding protocol covering
the separation of GM and non-GM material,
including clear industry liability.
We will negotiate for further reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to deliver
greater value for money while supporting the
sustainability of British farming. The new CAP
should reflect the importance we attach to the
environment, to ensuring food security and
to tackling global poverty. We advocate the
dismantling of market-distorting subsidies at
a pace that allows time for British farmers and
producers in developing countries to adapt. We
will minimise and reform on-farm inspections,
and abolish the Agricultural Wages Board.
The most pressing animal health problem in the
UK today is bovine tuberculosis (bTB), which
has led to the slaughter of over 250,000 cattle
since 1997. As part of a package of measures,
we will introduce a carefully-managed and
science-led policy of badger control in areas
with high and persistent levels of bTB .
Government should take the lead by procuring
more sustainably. We will ensure that food
procured by government departments, and
eventually the whole public sector, meets British
standards of production, wherever this can be
achieved without increasing overall costs.
We will introduce honesty in food labelling, if
necessary through legislation, so consumers
can be confident about where their food comes
from. This will ensure that meat labelled as
‘British’ is born and bred in Britain, and raised
to our high welfare standards. And we will
promote local food networks so that homes
and businesses can obtain supplies of locally-produced
food.
We will ensure a fair market for food suppliers
– especially farmers – by reducing the
burden of regulation. To ensure the grocery
supply code of practice is applied fairly, we
will introduce an independent supermarket
ombudsman.
Use natural resources
responsibly
We will introduce a Responsibility Deal on
waste – a voluntary arrangement among
producers to cut back on the production of
waste and improve its disposal – as we move
towards our goal of a zero-waste society.
Households need new incentives to go green,
so we will reward people who do the right
thing by encouraging councils to pay people
to recycle, while scrapping Labour’s plans for
new bin taxes on families. To help this happen,
we will put a floor under the standard rate of
landfill tax until 2020 to encourage alternative
forms of waste disposal.



With a rising population and growing strains
on our water supply, industry and customers
alike need new incentives to conserve water.
We will reform the water industry, and bring
in new measures to encourage businesses and
households to value this precious resource
more highly, and protect poorer households
from excessive rises in water bills.
To cope with the increased risk of flooding
associated with climate change, we will
take forward the findings of the Pitt Review
to improve our flood defences, prevent
unnecessary building in areas of high flood
risk, and ensure the country is better
equipped when flooding does take place.



Manchester
Manchester was the epicentre of the
industrial revolution, and the first
industrialised city in the world. Today, the
city is a national symbol of successful urban
regeneration. Over the past three decades,
Manchester has undergone extensive urban
renewal, transforming the city’s canals,
mills and warehouses into vibrant new
commercial, residential, and cultural spaces
– including the creation of the Imperial
War Museum North (pictured). As a result
of this regeneration, Manchester is one of
Britain’s most dynamic cities, and has been
voted amongst the best places in the country
to locate a business.



Promote our
national interest



A stronger Britain in a safer world
A Conservative government will defend our national security and support our brave Armed
Forces in everything they do. We will promote our national interest with an active foreign policy.
We will work constructively with the EU, but we will not hand over any more areas of power and
we will never join the Euro. We will honour our aid commitments and make sure this money works
for the poorest nations.
This country possesses great assets and advantages – a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council, a leading role in NATO , a strong relationship with the United States, a major role in the
affairs of the EU, and Armed Forces that are the envy of the world. We are a global trading nation
and home to the world’s pre-eminent language.
But, looking a decade or two ahead, powerful forces of economics and demography elsewhere
in the world will make it harder for us to maintain our influence. All this in a world that is
becoming more dangerous, where threats as diverse as state failure, international terrorism and
new forms of warfare are being amplified by the impact of climate change and the spread of nuclear
weapons technology. In a world of shifting economic power and increased threats, the UK stands
to lose a great deal of its ability to shape world affairs unless we act to reverse our declining status.
We no longer inhabit a world in which foreign and defence issues can be separated from
domestically-generated threats. Instead, we live in a world in which dangers, events and actions
abroad are inter-dependent with threats to our security at home. We must meet the threats we face
with a concerted response from the state. That response cannot just come from how we conduct our
foreign affairs, or organise our defence and internal security – it must cut across energy, education,
community cohesion, health, technology, international development and the environment too.



Labour have failed to deliver a unified and
coherent approach to national security.
They have not even kept their promise of a
comprehensive National Security Budget.
Their incompetence places our nation at risk.
Despite fighting two major wars in the last
decade, Labour have cut the target for the
trained strength of the Army, shrunk the size
of the Navy by a fifth and run down the RAF.
The men and women of our Armed Forces
are the ones charged with protecting our
nation’s security. But Labour’s dangerous
mismanagement has endangered lives and
harmed Britain’s capacity to defend itself.
Labour have been too slow to provide the
equipment, such as helicopters, which our
Forces on operations have badly needed. Our
brave men and women, their families, and our
veterans deserve the best for putting their lives
on the line to protect our liberties. We will
ensure they get the best.
A resilient nation
We understand the severity of the threats that
exist and will do all we can to make Britain
Defend our security
We will create a National Security Council to oversee all aspects of our security, chaired by the
Prime Minister. We are committed to succeeding in our mission in Afghanistan and will not leave
our Forces without the resources they need to fulfil this goal. We will repair the Military Covenant
with a series of measures to support service personnel, their families and veterans.
safe. We will establish a National Security
Council to co-ordinate responses to the dangers
we face, which will be chaired by the Prime
Minister. In addition, we will:
create a National Security • Adviser and a
new National Resilience Team for Homeland
Security;
• develop a National Security Strategy and
oversee a Strategic Defence and Security
Review that implements that strategy; and,
• establish a new Permanent Military
Command for Homeland Defence and
Security to provide a more structured
military contribution to homeland security.
Terrorism remains a major threat to our
country and some of the biggest threats to our
security do not come from abroad – they are
home grown. A Conservative government will
ban any organisations which advocate hate or
the violent overthrow of our society, such as
Hizb-ut-Tahrir, and close down organisations
which attempt to fund terrorism from the UK.
In Northern Ireland, we will continue to give
our fullest support to the police and other



agencies in their efforts to combat the threat
from dissident republican and other terrorist
organisations.
Support our brave Armed Forces
Our mission in Afghanistan is vital to our
national security. Success in Afghanistan will
be achieved when it is a more stable state,
able to manage its own security, resist outside
interference, and prevent terrorists from using
its territory as a safe haven. We will always
ensure our Forces have the resources they need
to carry out their mission properly, and we will
press other members of NATO to take their fair
share of the military burden. The training of
Afghanistan’s own security forces is key to the
success of the mission, and we will continue to
make it a priority.
Our Strategic Defence and Security Review
will ensure that resources for our Armed Forces
are matched to our foreign policy requirements.
We support the decision to renew Britain’s
submarine-based nuclear deterrent, based on
the Trident missile system.
The hopeless mismanagement of defence
procurement by this government has wasted
billions of taxpayers’ money and left our
Armed Forces underequipped and dangerously
exposed. We will review the structure of the
Ministry of Defence to reduce running costs by
25 per cent. We will reform the procurement
process to ensure the delivery of equipment on
time and on budget. We will release spending
on unnecessary and bureaucratic EU defence
initiatives and spend the money on our Armed
Forces. As part of that process, we will
re-evaluate our position with the European
Defence Agency.
Our commitment to look after the Armed
Forces and their families – the Military
Covenant – has been allowed to fall into
disrepair. This is one of the most damning
failures of Gordon Brown’s government. We
will restore the Military Covenant and ensure
that our Armed Forces, their families and
veterans are properly taken care of. To make
that happen, we will:
double the operational allowance;
• maximise rest and recuperation leave;
• ensure our servicemen and women are
treated in dedicated military wards in
hospital;
• change the rules so that service personnel are
not locked out of the voting system by rules
that Labour have introduced;
• use ‘pupil level annual school census’ data to
include service children within our plans for
a pupil premium in schools, ensuring they
attract extra funding;



provide university and 
• further education
scholarships for the children of servicemen
and women killed while on active duty,
backdated to 1990;
• pilot a mental health follow-up service for
those who have left the services; and,
• review the rules governing the awarding
of medals.



Iran
In Iran, hundreds of thousands of citizens calling for democratic reforms are using new
technologies to come together, coordinate their protests against the state, and communicate
with the outside world. The power of these information flows is growing rapidly. Every time
the Iranian state has tried to choke the flow of information to dampen down the protests, people
have turned to new technologies to share and access information. When the state cut off text
messaging services, protesters switched to social media like Twitter and Facebook. When foreign
journalists had their visas removed and had to leave the country, Iranians began to upload video
clips onto YouTube so that the government’s actions could continue to be scrutinised. And when
the government tried to ban popular websites, private citizens outside Iran set up proxy internet
servers so that Iranians could continue to access information.



A Conservative government’s approach
to foreign affairs will be based on liberal
Conservative principles. Liberal, because
Britain must be open and engaged with
the world, supporting human rights and
championing the cause of democracy and
the rule of law at every opportunity. But
Conservative, because our policy must be
hard-headed and practical, dealing with the
world as it is and not as we wish it were.
Our approach to foreign affairs is based on a
belief in freedom, human rights and democracy.
We are sceptical about grand utopian schemes to
remake the world. We will work patiently with
the grain of other societies, but we will always
support liberal values because they provide the
foundations for stability and prosperity.
Protecting Britain’s enlightened national
interest requires global engagement. We will
be safer if our values are strongly upheld and
widely respected in the world. Our national
identity is bound up in our historic global
role as an outward-looking nation, giving
generously to developing countries, and
providing a safe haven to genuine refugees.
A liberal Conservative foreign policy
We have great national assets and advantages to help us make the most of the opportunities we
face and to deal with challenges. We will engage positively with the world to deepen alliances and
build new partnerships. We will help reform international institutions, help those in need, and play
our part in tackling climate change and the proliferation of military nuclear technology.
promote our national interest A LIBERAL CONSERVATIVE
FOREIGN POLICY
It is not in our character to have a foreign policy
without a conscience or to turn our back on the
millions who live in poverty and conflict.
Promote our enlightened
national interest
A Conservative government will champion
a distinctive British foreign policy. We will
renew and reinforce our engagement with the
rest of the world and build up British influence
by deepening our alliances beyond Europe and
the United States, not only diplomatically but in
culture, education, commerce and security.
A Conservative government will always speak
up for freedom and human rights. Torture is
unacceptable and abhorrent, and we will never
condone it.
We will support humanitarian intervention
when it is practical and necessary, while
working with other countries to prevent conflict
arising.
Promoting Britain’s interests and values means
developing and strengthening our alliances and



reforming international institutions. To achieve
these goals, we will:
work to establish a new special • relationship
with India, the world’s largest democracy;
• seek closer engagement with China while
standing firm on human rights;
• elevate our relationships with many friendly
nations, including in the Middle East, as
well as North Africa, South Asia and Latin
America;
• press to keep the EU’s doors open to those
countries, including Turkey, that wish to join,
conditional on the rigorous application of the
accession criteria;
• support permanent seats on the United
Nations Security Council for Japan, India,
Germany, Brazil and African representation;
and,
• strengthen the Commonwealth as a focus
for promoting democratic values and
development.
We will work with our allies across the world
to prevent conflict and secure peace. We will
maintain a strong, close and frank relationship
with the United States. We will work closely
with other European countries to establish a
common approach to common problems, such
as climate change. We will be committed to
NATO as the ultimate guarantor of Europe’s
security. To ensure our global security further,
we will:
• work towards greater stability in Afghanistan
and Pakistan;
• support concerted international efforts
to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapon;
• support a two-state solution to the Middle
East Peace Process;
• promote stability in the Western Balkans;
• always be ready to assist Cypriots in their
efforts to agree a just, balanced and lasting
settlement to reunite their island; and,
• play our part in efforts to make the world
safer from the dangers of nuclear weapons
and nuclear proliferation.


The European Union has done much to
reconcile the painful division of Europe and to
spread democracy and the rule of law across
our continent. But it should not rest on those
achievements.
European countries need to work together to
boost global economic growth, fight global
poverty, and combat global climate change.
The European Union has a crucial part to play
in enabling the countries of Europe to meet
these great challenges of the 21st century. A
Conservative government will play an active
and energetic role in the European Union to
advance these causes.
We will stand for open markets, and a strong
transatlantic relationship; for an EU that looks
out to the world, and that builds strong and
open relations with rising powers like China
and India. And, like every other Member State,
we will fight our corner to promote our
national interests.
An open and democratic Europe
We will be positive members of the European Union but we are clear that there should be no
further extension of the EU’s power over the UK without the British people’s consent. We will
ensure that by law no future government can hand over areas of power to the EU or join the
Euro without a referendum of the British people. We will work to bring back key powers over
legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK.
promote our national interest AN OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC
EUROPE
We believe Britain’s interests are best served
by membership of a European Union that is an
association of its Member States. We will never
allow Britain to slide into a federal Europe.
Labour’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty
without the consent of the British people has
been a betrayal of this country’s democratic
traditions. In government, we will put in place
a number of measures to make sure this
shameful episode can never happen again.
Restore democratic control
In future, the British people must have their
say on any transfer of powers to the European
Union. We will amend the 1972 European
Communities Act so that any proposed future
Treaty that transferred areas of power, or
competences, would be subject to a referendum
– a ‘referendum lock’. A Conservative
government would never take the UK into
the Euro. Our amendment to the 1972 Act will
prevent any future government from doing
so without a referendum.



Unlike other European countries, the UK
does not have a written constitution. We will
introduce a United Kingdom Sovereignty Bill
to make it clear that ultimate authority stays in
this country, in our Parliament.
The Lisbon Treaty contains a number of socalled
‘ratchet clauses’, which allow the powers
of the EU to expand in the future without a
new Treaty. We do not believe that any of
these ‘ratchet clauses’ should be used to hand
over more powers from Britain to the EU. So
a Conservative government will not agree to
the UK’s participation in the establishment of a
European Public Prosecutor’s Office or permit
its jurisdiction over the UK. We will change the
1972 Act so that an Act of Parliament would be
required before any ‘ratchet clause’ could be
used. Additionally, the use of a major ‘ratchet
clause’ which amounted to the transfer of an
area of power to the EU would be subject to a
referendum.
The steady and unaccountable intrusion of
the European Union into almost every aspect
of our lives has gone too far. A Conservative
government will negotiate for three specific
guarantees – on the Charter of Fundamental
Rights, on criminal justice, and on social and
employment legislation – with our European
partners to return powers that we believe
should reside with the UK, not the EU. We
seek a mandate to negotiate the return of these
powers from the EU to the UK.



Project Umubano
Every summer for the past three years, the Conservative Party has been running
‘Project Umubano’ in Rwanda. Over that period, Conservative MPs and volunteers
have provided English lessons to 3,000 Rwandan primary school teachers,
renovated a school, established a small medical library at Kirambi Health Centre,
and built a community centre. Project Umubano is a sign of our commitment to One
World Conservatism, and our belief in the positive power of social action.

The global downturn has shaken up rich and
poor countries alike. For poor countries, it
threatens to undermine a decade’s growth and
poverty reduction. For rich countries, it puts
new pressures on household and government
budgets – nowhere more so than in the UK,
where Labour’s appalling mismanagement
of the economy has saddled us with
unprecedented levels of debt. But we should
use this opportunity to reaffirm, not abandon,
our values – which is why we will continue to
increase the level of British aid. We will do so
because it is in our national interest, as well
as being the right thing to do.
Deliver on our commitment to
the world’s poorest nations
A new Conservative government will be fully
committed to achieving, by 2013, the UN target
of spending 0.7 per cent of national income
as aid. We will stick to the rules laid down by
the OECD about what spending counts as aid.
We will legislate in the first session of a new
Parliament to lock in this level of spending for
every year from 2013.
One World Conservatism
We will honour our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income in aid, and ensure our
aid is transparent and properly targeted. We will spend at least £500 million a year to tackle
malaria. Both the British people and those who receive aid will get more control over how it is
spent. We will push for a trade deal which brings growth to the poorest countries, helps those
countries adapt to climate change, and puts in place the building blocks of wealth creation.
We support the Millennium Development
Goals and will continue to work towards them.
We will maintain an independent Department
for International Development (DFID) and keep
aid untied from commercial interests.
We will be completely transparent about the
cost and performance of DFID programmes by
independently evaluating programmes and by
introducing, where appropriate, payment
by results.
Our bargain with taxpayers is this: in return
for contributing your hard-earned money to
helping the world’s poorest people, it is our
duty to spend every penny of aid effectively.
We will ensure British aid money is properly
spent by publishing full details of British aid
on the DFID website. This will include
spending data on a project-by-project basis,
published in an open and standardised format
so that it can be used by third party websites.
In addition, we will work to bring about
improved transparency of aid spending by
other development organisations.



We will create a new MyAid Fund to allow
British people a direct say on aid spending, as
well as giving people in developing countries
more say over how aid is spent in their
communities.
Under Labour, our aid funding is not used
in a focused way, and is sometimes spent in
countries that should be looking after their
own poor citizens. So we will stop giving aid
to China and Russia and review which other
countries should get British aid. We will focus
more on the poorest, paying particular attention
to development within the Commonwealth.
A key aim of our aid is to make sure everyone
gets access to the basics: clean water,
sanitation, healthcare and education. We will
focus particularly on the rights of women,
children and disabled people to access these
services. Malaria continues to kill nearly a
million people per year, despite the fact that it
is easily preventable and treatable. So, as part
of our commitment to increase aid funding, a
Conservative government will spend at least
£500 million per year tackling malaria and will
strongly support efforts to develop a malaria
vaccine.
Trade and economic growth are the only
sustainable way for developing countries to
escape poverty, which is why we will put
maximum effort into achieving an ambitious,
pro-development global trade deal. Our aid
programme will help poor countries put in
place the building blocks of wealth creation:
property rights, effective public services,
stability and the rule of law.
We will provide a more integrated approach
to post-conflict reconstruction where the
British military is involved – building on the
Stabilisation Unit in Whitehall and creating
a new Stabilisation and Reconstruction Force
to bridge the gap between the military and the
reconstruction effort.
To help deliver on our commitment to
developing countries, we will:
establish a Poverty Impact
• Fund to support
innovative and effective British poverty-fighting
groups which do not currently
qualify for government funding;
• explore ways to help the very poorest
developing countries take part in
international climate change negotiations,
and work to make our aid ‘climate-smart’;
• end Labour’s use of the Export Credit
Guarantee Department to support investment
in dirty fossil fuel power stations, and instead
use it to help spread new green energy
technology to developing countries; and,
• encourage the establishment of a Pan-African
Free Trade Area, which has the potential to
transform that continent’s economies.
