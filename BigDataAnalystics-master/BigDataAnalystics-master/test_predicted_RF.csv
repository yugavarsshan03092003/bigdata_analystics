It is so demoralizing to phone patients all day to beg them to take AZ  CovidVaccine  I was able to get some uptake  44 booked   but I ve been on the phone with patients for 10 hours  on my  day off   lucky my child  for whom it is April break  is understanding   156 doses to go;0
That is bonkers  My 12y child summarized the chaos   First you had PPE shortages and lineups for tests and so many people died  then no  PaidSickDays  then problems with  CovidVaccine rollout   There are thousands of family docs   nurses offering to immunize  No excuses;0
Yes to 1  transparent   effective communication  2  lowering age of cutoff below 55  and 3  expanding role of primary care  1   3 should have been the foundation of the  CovidVaccine rollout  Speaking as a family doctor who spent hours phoning patients today  this is demoralizing;1
Phone call to a patient  They thought it might be better to wait and book with public health for the mass  CovidVaccine clinic where they d get Pfizer or Moderna  I talked to them  discussed the safety of AZ   Okay  then  I d much rather get my shot from you   Booked  Family med;1

So what are we going to do to streamline getting the  CovidVaccine out to Ottawans  Because multiple booking systems  vaccine  shopping   and limited use of primary care are factors that are holding us back  Struggle to fill AZ appointments;0
Started at 7am  4 5 hours later clinic messages continue to overflow with Ottawans 55y  stepping up to book their AZ  CovidVaccine in our office  Not how I usually spend a Saturday as a family doc  but this is great   please involve more primary care  We can do this;0
When the health system breaks down  we all suffer  Day two of speaking to patients about registering for their AZ  CovidVaccine  A few more responsible people are now booked for their jab  But  frustration here  about misinformation   shopping for vaccines;0
Why do I have the vaccine  or why am I phoning patients on Saturday to book them  We ve been lobbying for months to get primary care involved in  COVIDVaccine rollout  I even held a panel of advocates across Canada to speak with  and   This is family med;0
To do that  every family doc should be able to immunize our patients  and every person 55 and older who has an offer to take the AZ vaccine should do so  People shopping around for a  CovidVaccine  misinformation    multiple booking systems hinder this;0

No seriously  Boomers  Don t shop around for the  CovidVaccine you   want   Take what s offered  It is all safe  Let go of misinformation  Let go of the entitlement  If you turn down AZ to wait for Moderna/Pfizer  you re taking a dose that could be offered to a younger person;1
Just interrupted the reporter on live news because she asked about the safety of AZ vaccine  Never in 11 years of practicing medicine has a patient asked me which brand of life saving vaccine they d receive  If we want out of this pandemic  take the  CovidVaccine you re offered;0

The Ontario gov't messed up  CovidVaccine distribution  situation ongoing  Now this  Ontario enacts  one of the strictest lockdowns yet seen in the Western world  including empowering police to stop and question any person seen outside their home    Canada;0

For those who still don't get it  When you go to a restaurant  do you ask your server to show you their papers to see if they have all their vaccinations  No  because YOU HAVE ALL OF YOURS  So  if you believe and have faith in the  CovidVaccine  get it and shut up about it;0

Ok people  let's put this as simple as possible  If the  CovidVaccine for  COVID19 is a  vaccine  which it's not  and gives you  Immunity  which it doesn't  and you trust it and get it  why on earth does it matter if anyone else gets it  You are protected  End of story;0
Amazing the difference 2 weeks makes  At least  are allowing staff to show reasons why they aren't  vaccinated  Fans won't get that option  They aren't including players in the demand to get the  CovidVaccine   guess they are protecting their valuable assets   COVID19;0
It is shocking the number of people who are terrified of catching  COVID19 because  as they see it  just my luck I will be the one that dies   But when asked if they will get the  CovidVaccine they're all  sign me up   So  just your luck you will die from Covid but not the jab;0

Herd immunity comes when a certain   of people have immunity to a virus  According to the Covid god Dr  Fauci  the  CovidVaccine doesn't make you immune  you can still get   spread the virus  so the only ones immune are the ones who have had  COVID19  Might be awhile yet;0
Oh we'll get herd immunity  because those vaccinated can still get  COVID19  hopefully with less severity than w/out the  CovidVaccine  and then they'll be immune  And doctors are saying some already have  Immunity due to being exposed to previous coronaviruses;0
CDC website says people who have had chickenpox should not get the chickenpox vaccine  If we  followthescience  if you have had  COVID19 should you get the  CovidVaccine  Had it a few months ago  So just because I question an experimental drug does not mean I am antivaxx at all;0
